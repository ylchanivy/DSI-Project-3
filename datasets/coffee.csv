https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/dgkm1o/nitro_coffee_project/#

&gt;Hi guys,
&gt;
&gt;First time posting here. I have a small project I'm working on at work. I'm trying to make some revisions on our cold brew portable jockey box so that it can be used as a near standalone &gt;portable nitro kegerator. I'm I am trying to build from scratch something similar to the Kegoutlet's Nitro Infuser/Micromatic Mininim nitrogen infusion module. I have taken apart both and &gt;examined the components and am curious about one part in particular which might be a hitch in the planning phase.
&gt;
&gt;Inside there is a T union for when the cold brew and the nitrogen blend. I'm curious if a vacuum ejector is what that part is as its pretty bulbous so I don't have a clear idea on what it &gt;could be besides ordering the part and trying it out. And if it was then the mental orientation of the gas/liquid entering the union seems to go against the intended connection points that I &gt;would assume vacuum ejectors to opperrate at.
&gt;
&gt;But that is another point of concern that I can figure out down the road. The two bigger questions for this would be in how to eliminate two big pink elephants to make the jockey box &gt;standalone. It's the kegs for the cold brew and the nitrogen tank.
&gt;
&gt;One idea that I am having is to use a Flojet BW5000 to push the cold brew from a holding tank that I can place in the lower shelf of the jockey box and have that entering the infusion &gt;module. has anyone tried using the Flojet with anything other than water before and if so what was the results in your attempt.
&gt;
&gt;For the nitrogen I was looking up nitrogen pumps/generators that are small scale and I found one from Bunn the Nitron that I can utilize for that. The only concern I would have is that if i&gt;t could project sufficient pressure. If not I might need to have a fill canister and a regulator somewhere into the build for it which seems likely.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone tried any of this and if so please throw some ideas. I'll keep updates on the project as new developments come up.
&gt;
&gt;Here's the old jockey box I'm working on for this project I made a year ago. https://imgur.com/gallery/u33oMii

UPDATE:

So I ran the system after getting all the proper fittings and frankensteining hose's and adaptors so that I can run it to a nitrogen tank and regulator that we have. Think 1/2 barb fitting being reduced to standard 3/8 line reduced to a 1/4 line to go into the nitrogen gas adjustment valve. It works perfectly to my expectations and comes out like it does for our built in kegerator and nitrogen infuser.

Video Update of the output: https://imgur.com/gallery/VP0W0Ds

Update with Guide: 
Rough guide on how to make one for yourself

So the basic idea on building a nitro cold brew kegerator is simple. You get either a jockey box or an actual refrigerated kegerator system. The latter is simple and takes most of the work out of the build but also the most expensive. If you go with a jockey box route you can reduce the price from a couple grand to somewhere close to 1/10th the price; if not more depending on how simple or elaborate you want to make it. 

If you choose to go with the former option then keep reading, other wise skip the next few paragraphs.

**Box**
If you want to make it simple there are jockey box kits you can buy that people usually have for tailgate parties. Those have pre-tapped holes and fittings for the beer taps you can swap out for high flow draft taps you want for nitro cold brew, as well as the coils and shank fitting for your product line which ideally would be going to a keg of some sort. (I will be going into how do run a system without a keg IE a simple container/bucket/cambro). And another option is similar to what I have done in the main post which is a beer tower. The one thing that you need to be mindful of for the tower is that you will need to do some fittings to get the beer tower lines to fit to the cooling coils. If the coil have npt threaded fittings this is simple and jsut involves down sizing enough to get a small push in fitting that the beer line can go to. Otherwise if its a naked coil with no fittings this can be simply achieve by getting a food safe line that has a ID that is just barely smaller than the coil OD so that once you fit it on you can tighten to get a airtight seal with a worm clamp. 

**Lines**
To make your life eternally easier buy some no drip DQC's (aka QDC, quick disconnect, quick connects, dripless quick connects, ect) And have that before AND after the coil so that you can take out the coil from the jockey box and clean more efficiently. For the lines doing into the box from the gas and the keg/product container you can do it many ways. As you can see in my pictures there is that weird awkward box with the DQC on them and that was a result of measuring once and cutting before double checking clearance space. The smarter thing to do now that I have worked on this over the year would be to use a bulkhead passthrough fitting/threaded tube that you can anchor down with a lock and nut. From there I would get some kind of threaded adaptor to fit DQC's to them to give it a good clean look for the outside and just a regular line inside to the DQC that feeds into the cold coils. And then DQC's ont he sankey or keg coupler lines as well.

**Nitrogen Gas**
Now is for the Nitrogen gas. The typical way would be to connect it to either a nitrogen tank or a nitrogen generator system with a regulator to adjust the pressure to push out the cold brew in a keg to dispense the coldbrew through a tap. For this I would recommend using a manifold to split the gas line to push the cold brew in the keg and another to go into the infusion system I will elaborate on later. Each of the output from the manifold should have a shut off valve and attach air quick connects to them so that you can close off lines you are not using or dont have yet for easy expansion. If you are using a sankey keg or a more typical standard keg coupler I recommend attaching air quick connects to the lines for clean and quick attachments to the box. 

**No Keg method**
For a system that is not used in a keg you would need some kind of pump system to push the cold brew through the system when you pull down the tap. For this you will want a pump with a pressure switch like a flojet. I think the best option would be the [flojet bevjet compact](https://www.amazon.com/Flojet-Bevjet-Compact-Adapter-approx/dp/B06XPY9CSN) as it is sold options for what fittings you want in our case push in fittings. You can then just simply put your line for the bevjet input into the container and let it sit in the bottom. Or you can modify your container by dirlling out a hole near the base and fitting a [right angle push in stem fitting](https://www.amazon.com/John-Guest-Copolymer-Connect-Fitting/dp/B007COM8TI) inside of it so that you can syphon out as much of the cold brew and not waste it(noone lieks to waste good cold brew). From there you follow the same method and fit the cold brew to a DQC to the in line from the [Bevjet](https://www.amazon.com/Flojet-Bevjet-Compact-Adapter-approx/dp/B06XPY9CSN)

**Nitro Infusion System**
Now this is the meat aand bones of the reason why I made this post. The nitro infusion system. You can go out and spend $600~800 for a completed looking box that you attached to your system and call it a day. But you can also just buy 4 to 5 fittings to do the exact same thing. First the required ones will be an [inline speed control valve](https://www.grainger.com/product/SMC-In-Line-Speed-Control-Valve-4DGV3?cm_sp=Home-_-MyPurchasedProducts-_-4DGV3&amp;cm_vc=HPMPPZ), T/Y splitter fitting, and 2 [liquid check valve fittings](https://www.grainger.com/product/JOHN-GUEST-Check-Valve-2JFY8?cm_sp=Home-_-MyPurchasedProducts-_-2JFY8&amp;cm_vc=HPMPPZ)

Arrange them like so:


Column A | Column B | Column C | Column D | Column E
---------|----------|----------|----------|----------
Line out|&lt;&lt;&lt;|T/Y Splitter|&lt;&lt;&lt;|Check Valve
 | |^| | 
 | |Check Valve|&lt;&lt;&lt;|Control Valve

This would be located inside of the box and the smart location to place it would be in between the output of the cold coil and the input of the beer tower/spout.
Side note I forgot to mention you need to run a line of nitrogen gas into the box so be creative on how you want to do it I've explained how to get the cold brew in here so its simple from the manifold that the nitrogen gas spits from the outside.

And then you just adjust the gas with the speed control valve to get a nice creamy texture for the cold brew","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preface, just updated my last few posts with a short guide on what I went through to make my nitro jockey box so that its more visible for anyone who wnats to take a crack at it. link to the original post for the comments

And if it was then the mental orientation of the gas/liquid entering the union seems to go against the intended connection points that I &amp;gt;would assume vacuum ejectors to opperrate at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is another point of concern that I can figure out down the road. The two bigger questions for this would be in how to eliminate two big pink elephants to make the jockey box &amp;gt;standalone. It&amp;#39;s the kegs for the cold brew and the nitrogen tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One idea that I am having is to use a Flojet BW5000 to push the cold brew from a holding tank that I can place in the lower shelf of the jockey box and have that entering the infusion &amp;gt;module. has anyone tried using the Flojet with anything other than water before and if so what was the results in your attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the nitrogen I was looking up nitrogen pumps/generators that are small scale and I found one from Bunn the Nitron that I can utilize for that. The only concern I would have is that if i&amp;gt;t could project sufficient pressure. If not I might need to have a fill canister and a regulator somewhere into the build for it which seems likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone tried any of this and if so please throw some ideas. I&amp;#39;ll keep updates on the project as new developments come up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the old jockey box I&amp;#39;m working on for this project I made a year ago. &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/u33oMii""&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/u33oMii&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I ran the system after getting all the proper fittings and frankensteining hose&amp;#39;s and adaptors so that I can run it to a nitrogen tank and regulator that we have. Think 1/2 barb fitting being reduced to standard 3/8 line reduced to a 1/4 line to go into the nitrogen gas adjustment valve. It works perfectly to my expectations and comes out like it does for our built in kegerator and nitrogen infuser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video Update of the output: &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/VP0W0Ds""&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/VP0W0Ds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update with Guide: 
Rough guide on how to make one for yourself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the basic idea on building a nitro cold brew kegerator is simple. You get either a jockey box or an actual refrigerated kegerator system. The latter is simple and takes most of the work out of the build but also the most expensive. If you go with a jockey box route you can reduce the price from a couple grand to somewhere close to 1/10th the price; if not more depending on how simple or elaborate you want to make it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you choose to go with the former option then keep reading, other wise skip the next few paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Box&lt;/strong&gt;
If you want to make it simple there are jockey box kits you can buy that people usually have for tailgate parties. Those have pre-tapped holes and fittings for the beer taps you can swap out for high flow draft taps you want for nitro cold brew, as well as the coils and shank fitting for your product line which ideally would be going to a keg of some sort. (I will be going into how do run a system without a keg IE a simple container/bucket/cambro). And another option is similar to what I have done in the main post which is a beer tower. The one thing that you need to be mindful of for the tower is that you will need to do some fittings to get the beer tower lines to fit to the cooling coils. If the coil have npt threaded fittings this is simple and jsut involves down sizing enough to get a small push in fitting that the beer line can go to. Otherwise if its a naked coil with no fittings this can be simply achieve by getting a food safe line that has a ID that is just barely smaller than the coil OD so that once you fit it on you can tighten to get a airtight seal with a worm clamp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lines&lt;/strong&gt;
To make your life eternally easier buy some no drip DQC&amp;#39;s (aka QDC, quick disconnect, quick connects, dripless quick connects, ect) And have that before AND after the coil so that you can take out the coil from the jockey box and clean more efficiently. For the lines doing into the box from the gas and the keg/product container you can do it many ways. As you can see in my pictures there is that weird awkward box with the DQC on them and that was a result of measuring once and cutting before double checking clearance space. The smarter thing to do now that I have worked on this over the year would be to use a bulkhead passthrough fitting/threaded tube that you can anchor down with a lock and nut. From there I would get some kind of threaded adaptor to fit DQC&amp;#39;s to them to give it a good clean look for the outside and just a regular line inside to the DQC that feeds into the cold coils. And then DQC&amp;#39;s ont he sankey or keg coupler lines as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nitrogen Gas&lt;/strong&gt;
Now is for the Nitrogen gas. The typical way would be to connect it to either a nitrogen tank or a nitrogen generator system with a regulator to adjust the pressure to push out the cold brew in a keg to dispense the coldbrew through a tap. For this I would recommend using a manifold to split the gas line to push the cold brew in the keg and another to go into the infusion system I will elaborate on later. Each of the output from the manifold should have a shut off valve and attach air quick connects to them so that you can close off lines you are not using or dont have yet for easy expansion. If you are using a sankey keg or a more typical standard keg coupler I recommend attaching air quick connects to the lines for clean and quick attachments to the box. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Keg method&lt;/strong&gt;
For a system that is not used in a keg you would need some kind of pump system to push the cold brew through the system when you pull down the tap. For this you will want a pump with a pressure switch like a flojet. I think the best option would be the &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Flojet-Bevjet-Compact-Adapter-approx/dp/B06XPY9CSN""&gt;flojet bevjet compact&lt;/a&gt; as it is sold options for what fittings you want in our case push in fittings. You can then just simply put your line for the bevjet input into the container and let it sit in the bottom. Or you can modify your container by dirlling out a hole near the base and fitting a &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/John-Guest-Copolymer-Connect-Fitting/dp/B007COM8TI""&gt;right angle push in stem fitting&lt;/a&gt; inside of it so that you can syphon out as much of the cold brew and not waste it(noone lieks to waste good cold brew). From there you follow the same method and fit the cold brew to a DQC to the in line from the &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Flojet-Bevjet-Compact-Adapter-approx/dp/B06XPY9CSN""&gt;Bevjet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nitro Infusion System&lt;/strong&gt;
Now this is the meat aand bones of the reason why I made this post. The nitro infusion system. You can go out and spend $600~800 for a completed looking box that you attached to your system and call it a day. But you can also just buy 4 to 5 fittings to do the exact same thing. First the required ones will be an &lt;a href=""https://www.grainger.com/product/SMC-In-Line-Speed-Control-Valve-4DGV3?cm_sp=Home-_-MyPurchasedProducts-_-4DGV3&amp;amp;cm_vc=HPMPPZ""&gt;inline speed control valve&lt;/a&gt;, T/Y splitter fitting, and 2 &lt;a href=""https://www.grainger.com/product/JOHN-GUEST-Check-Valve-2JFY8?cm_sp=Home-_-MyPurchasedProducts-_-2JFY8&amp;amp;cm_vc=HPMPPZ""&gt;liquid check valve fittings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrange them like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Column A&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Column B&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Column C&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Column D&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Column E&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Line out&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;T/Y Splitter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Check Valve&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;^&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Check Valve&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Control Valve&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be located inside of the box and the smart location to place it would be in between the output of the cold coil and the input of the beer tower/spout.
Side note I forgot to mention you need to run a line of nitrogen gas into the box so be creative on how you want to do it I&amp;#39;ve explained how to get the cold brew in here so its simple from the manifold that the nitrogen gas spits from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you just adjust the gas with the speed control valve to get a nice creamy texture for the cold brew&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway - I've been having a wide range of results on the total time of my brew. From around 3:15 to up to 5 minutes. The grind is just a bit finer than medium and I don't think it is the cause.

I have noticed that when I put in the dry filter and then wet it that sometimes it seems to make a seal around the complete circumference. And sometimes it lists to one side creating a seal all the way up and leaves a little gap across the way. 

I am pretty sure the shorter brew times are when more air can easily get into the bowl. And the longer brew times are when the seal is tight.

When I look at a picture of a Chemex it looks like the pour spout has groove that extends far enough down into the bowl as to keep a full seal from ever happening. Which, I would assume, would lead to more consistent brew times since the the water can pass through without artificial restriction.

I've only linked to one review, but there are many like it. This particular review was left in 2013.

The Amazon product page for the Bistro says ""

## Conical Burr

The conical stainless steel burr grinder provides a consistent grind with no sharpening required.""

&amp;#x200B;

But it doesn't say anything about the gears, specifically. The burr might be stainless steel (?) but the gears may not.

Customer service/warranty for Bodum also seems to be very lacking per reviews. I can't even seem to find their customer service phone number on their site.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know if the gears have been replaced from plastic to another material? Not willing to spend more than the $80 or so for a grinder, and I see that the white color is on sale for a little bit below that price.

EDIT: I found this number:   1-800-23-BODUM (26386)  from the warranty PDF on Amazon. I called the number, and got some special ""promotion for people over the age of 50"" line. Sounds scammy.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reviewing some of the reviews on Amazon for this model, I clearly see that a point of &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PGICZAXORIPU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=B0043095WW""&gt;failure is the plastic gears&lt;/a&gt;/gear shaft. I&amp;#39;ve only linked to one review, but there are many like it. This particular review was left in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Amazon product page for the Bistro says &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conical Burr&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conical stainless steel burr grinder provides a consistent grind with no sharpening required.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it doesn&amp;#39;t say anything about the gears, specifically. The burr might be stainless steel (?) but the gears may not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer service/warranty for Bodum also seems to be very lacking per reviews. I can&amp;#39;t even seem to find their customer service phone number on their site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

I've been experimenting on-and-off with this type of brewing. It is highly impractical for travel/quick preparation, but I'm starting to like it more and more as my ""fake pour-over"" method. I don't have the right hardware to do a decent pourover (mainly I would need a new kettle), but anyway, this is what I've been playing with:

- Start with 15-20g medium fine ground coffee (weighing after grinding) in the Aeropress in the original configuration (non-invert).

- Add 6x grind weight hot water, blooms/stir gently for 30 seconds. At 1 minute, use a few 1/2 inch plunges to force the brew through the aeropress (plunge about half an inch so that the coffee is forced through the filter, then lift plunger and repeat so that air is not sucked back through the Aeropress). Repeat till air is hissing through the grinds, 10-15 seconds.

- Add 10x grind weight hot water, stir gently to break up the compressed coffee at the bottom. Do a regular plunge at 1 minute, second brew time about 1:20. 

I'm not saying this is optimal or anything, just relatively easy to pull off. I find I get a sweeter brew with distinct flavors that is less bitter and less ""muddy"" in character. It also let's you brew a larger cup of coffee (e.g. using 20g of coffee, I end up with ~320 mL of finished coffee, which doesn't fit in an aeropress). 

Downsides - obviously it is twice the work, and therefore twice as fiddly (arguably even more fiddly with the initial extraction requiring small plunges). It also seems to require a fresher filter. I reuse my filters 10+ times, but this method works better with a much newer filter. Also, maybe I'm just crazy and don't know what coffee is supposed to taste like. 

Anyway, curious to hear if anyone else has tried 2x or more aeropress brews (I recall reading about one person at a competition using this approach, but they apparently didn't do well). I tried several configurations of 3x brewing, but I couldn't get consistent results (waaay to fiddly), and often ended up over-extracting things.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else played around with Aeropress double extraction recipes?

All, I was inspired by the Canekicker recipe seen on here as well as a gentleman named Perger and articles on Barista hustle and other websites. I made this chart so you can achieve hardness you desire from either tap water or water available to you at store filling stations etc. The Primo water dispenser at my Walmart is tested at 0 dKH 0 dGH (using aquarium test kit) and I aim for 35 ppm alkalinity (2 KH) and 85 ppm mineral hardness (aka 5 GH). Therefore I add 20.5 grains of baking soda and 65.1 grains of Epsom Salt heptahydrate. I am easily able to use grains because I have a reloading scale for ammunition, but you can multiply by 454/7000 to convert to grams if you have an accurate high resolution scale.

 I think the Canekicker recipe is a little high in hardness for me so mine is toned down a little bit. On the other hand my baking soda additions come out different than other sites tell you. A lot of them seem to be using math that baking soda dissociates to 495 ppm as CaCO3 but I believe it should be calculated as 381 ppm as CaCO3, so one site would list my dose as coming out to 40 ppm whereas I believe it's actually closer to 30. This is one reason among many that I target 35 (I am close to either one that is ""correct""). Mine is very close to the Perger recipe. Here are two more images, showing the calculator I developed which allows me to put in a target along with source water information (tap at x/y, RO at 0/0, etc) and finally the Perger and Canekicker recipes just as a check you can look at.

Canekicker's recipe in the image above makes 1 gallon that is then used as a 10% solution, IE if I am making a pourover I would use 50 mL (g) of his solution and 450 mL (g) of source (RO) water. Thus it makes a total of 37.85 Liters of solution or 10 gallons. 

Because I buy water in 5 gal bottles what I do is remove 1/2 gallon from the bottle, mix in my salts and heat it up and stir it, then pour it back into the bottle. Really I am just making the entire 5 gallon solution, and I could direct dose to the bottle if I felt it would mix OK.  An hour or so later it is sufficiently mixed for use; I have a $9 pump that sits on the 5 gallon bottle and I fill a 1 gallon pitcher in my fridge with this which lets me fill my drip maker or make pourovers for 4-5 days before I pump another gallon in.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

I used to use a moka pot (stove top) to make coffee, using 80% arabica and 20% robusta pre-ground coffee (supermarket one, powdery and rather dry).

By reading posts here I realised I should try freshly ground coffee. So I got a burr grinder and bought some hasbean blake black blend beans, freshly roasted (~7-10 days from roasting now).

I tried to grind at different coarseness level but I was getting always an underextracted coffee, very acidic and watery.
So I kept making the ground finer and finer, I think up to espresso level (max level in the grinder), but for some reasons it still get watery and acidic and I don't understand why.

What I reckon is that the supermarket moka ground is very dry, while mine is very sticky/oily (like wet sand? I can almost shape it) and this makes the stove pot pass easily through it somehow?

Indeed, the supermarket one takes a lot of time to build pressure and go out, while with the freshly roasted it goes out quickly.

So to summarise I tried to compress the grounds and to make it finer, but I can't seem to get the stove pot build enough pressure to extract the coffee at the right temperature/for the right amount of time.

Any suggestion? Maybe I should try less oily beans? Even finer grouding? Dry the beans more? Wait them to be slightly stale?

Nice flavour, could get nice acidity which I enjoy, and repeatable results.

Queue the death of my Hob, an upgrade to Induction, and therefor an upgrade of my Moka pot for induction. A 4 cup Moka Venus.

This is giving me dreadful results. Everyday, twice a day, for a month.

First of all, The 4 Cup Moka Venus has a SMALLER coffee capacity, than my 3 cup Moka Express. But delivers more, (but weaker) coffee. What? Why?

I can't control the pot, it's either not enough heat to create pressure to force water through the grounds (80°C/100°C), or too much pressure and spluttering (120°C). Either way Results are burnt in taste, and weak. There is no middle ground between 100°C and 120°C.

Results are NOT repeatable. My girlfriend can get a good shot out sometimes. She swears by 80°C. When I use 80°C I don't get enough pressure. Sometimes 100°C works well for me, but still not particularly great taste. 120°C at least I can get enough water through, it just splutters the entire time. We're doing the exact same method. I just cannot wrap my head around it, it's inconsistent. 

Change in grind size, amount of coffee, temperature, and bean variety have not improved my situation. The only thing that has helped my case slightly is starting from cold water instead of off the boil, which is the opposite effect of the results I got in the Express. Why?

So those of you who are using induction to make their coffee, what's your method, what are you using, and what are your results like?

Are induction hobs just not suitable for stovetop coffee?

Is the Venus crap? [Moka Induction](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bialetti-Moka-Induction-Coffee-Makers/dp/B00LK9CM5Q) better? 

Should I get a cast iron pan for a Moka Express?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was using a 3 Cup Bialetti Moka Express pot on an Electric hob and getting great results. Nice flavour, could get nice acidity which I enjoy, and repeatable results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queue the death of my Hob, an upgrade to Induction, and therefor an upgrade of my Moka pot for induction. A 4 cup Moka Venus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is giving me dreadful results. Everyday, twice a day, for a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, The 4 Cup Moka Venus has a SMALLER coffee capacity, than my 3 cup Moka Express. But delivers more, (but weaker) coffee. What? Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t control the pot, it&amp;#39;s either not enough heat to create pressure to force water through the grounds (80°C/100°C), or too much pressure and spluttering (120°C). Either way Results are burnt in taste, and weak. There is no middle ground between 100°C and 120°C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results are NOT repeatable. My girlfriend can get a good shot out sometimes. She swears by 80°C. When I use 80°C I don&amp;#39;t get enough pressure. Sometimes 100°C works well for me, but still not particularly great taste. 120°C at least I can get enough water through, it just splutters the entire time. We&amp;#39;re doing the exact same method. I just cannot wrap my head around it, it&amp;#39;s inconsistent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change in grind size, amount of coffee, temperature, and bean variety have not improved my situation. The only thing that has helped my case slightly is starting from cold water instead of off the boil, which is the opposite effect of the results I got in the Express. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So those of you who are using induction to make their coffee, what&amp;#39;s your method, what are you using, and what are your results like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are induction hobs just not suitable for stovetop coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

Hi guys,  

First time posting here. I have a small project I'm working on at work. I'm trying to make some revisions on our cold brew portable jockey box so that it can be used as a near standalone portable nitro kegerator. I'm I am trying to build from scratch something similar to the Kegoutlet's Nitro Infuser/Micromatic Mininim nitrogen infusion module. I have taken apart both and examined the components and am curious about one part in particular which might be a hitch in the planning phase.  

Inside there is a T union for when the cold brew and the nitrogen blend. I'm curious if a vacuum ejector is what that part is as its pretty bulbous so I don't have a clear idea on what it could be besides ordering the part and trying it out. And if it was then the mental orientation of the gas/liquid entering the union seems to go against the intended connection points that I would assume vacuum ejectors to opperrate at.

But that is another point of concern that I can figure out down the road. The two bigger questions for this would be in how to eliminate two big pink elephants to make the jockey box standalone. It's the kegs for the cold brew and the nitrogen tank.  

One idea that I am having is to use a Flojet BW5000 to push the cold brew from a holding tank that I can place in the lower shelf of the jockey box and have that entering the infusion module. has anyone tried using the Flojet with anything other than water before and if so what was the results in your attempt.  

For the nitrogen I was looking up nitrogen pumps/generators that are small scale and I found one from Bunn the Nitron that I can utilize for that. The only concern I would have is that if it could project sufficient pressure. If not I might need to have a fill canister and a regulator somewhere into the build for it which seems likely.


Has anyone tried any of this and if so please throw some ideas. I'll keep updates on the project as new developments come up.

Here's the old jockey box I'm working on for this project I made a year ago.

UPDATE:

So I ran the system after getting all the proper fittings and frankensteining hose's and adaptors so that I can run it to a nitrogen tank and regulator that we have. Think 1/2 barb fitting being reduced to standard 3/8 line reduced to a 1/4 line to go into the nitrogen gas adjustment valve. It works perfectly to my expectations and comes out like it does for our built in kegerator and nitrogen infuser.

Rough guide on how to make one for yourself

So the basic idea on building a nitro cold brew kegerator is simple. You get either a jockey box or an actual refrigerated kegerator system. The latter is simple and takes most of the work out of the build but also the most expensive. If you go with a jockey box route you can reduce the price from a couple grand to somewhere close to 1/10th the price; if not more depending on how simple or elaborate you want to make it. 

If you choose to go with the former option then keep reading, other wise skip the next few paragraphs.

**Box**
If you want to make it simple there are jockey box kits you can buy that people usually have for tailgate parties. Those have pre-tapped holes and fittings for the beer taps you can swap out for high flow draft taps you want for nitro cold brew, as well as the coils and shank fitting for your product line which ideally would be going to a keg of some sort. (I will be going into how do run a system without a keg IE a simple container/bucket/cambro). And another option is similar to what I have done in the main post which is a beer tower. The one thing that you need to be mindful of for the tower is that you will need to do some fittings to get the beer tower lines to fit to the cooling coils. If the coil have npt threaded fittings this is simple and jsut involves down sizing enough to get a small push in fitting that the beer line can go to. Otherwise if its a naked coil with no fittings this can be simply achieve by getting a food safe line that has a ID that is just barely smaller than the coil OD so that once you fit it on you can tighten to get a airtight seal with a worm clamp. 

**Lines**
To make your life eternally easier buy some no drip DQC's (aka QDC, quick disconnect, quick connects, dripless quick connects, ect) And have that before AND after the coil so that you can take out the coil from the jockey box and clean more efficiently. For the lines doing into the box from the gas and the keg/product container you can do it many ways. As you can see in my pictures there is that weird awkward box with the DQC on them and that was a result of measuring once and cutting before double checking clearance space. The smarter thing to do now that I have worked on this over the year would be to use a bulkhead passthrough fitting/threaded tube that you can anchor down with a lock and nut. From there I would get some kind of threaded adaptor to fit DQC's to them to give it a good clean look for the outside and just a regular line inside to the DQC that feeds into the cold coils. And then DQC's ont he sankey or keg coupler lines as well.

**Nitrogen Gas**
Now is for the Nitrogen gas. The typical way would be to connect it to either a nitrogen tank or a nitrogen generator system with a regulator to adjust the pressure to push out the cold brew in a keg to dispense the coldbrew through a tap. For this I would recommend using a manifold to split the gas line to push the cold brew in the keg and another to go into the infusion system I will elaborate on later. Each of the output from the manifold should have a shut off valve and attach air quick connects to them so that you can close off lines you are not using or dont have yet for easy expansion. If you are using a sankey keg or a more typical standard keg coupler I recommend attaching air quick connects to the lines for clean and quick attachments to the box. 

**No Keg method**
For a system that is not used in a keg you would need some kind of pump system to push the cold brew through the system when you pull down the tap. For this you will want a pump with a pressure switch like a flojet. I think the best option would be the [flojet bevjet compact](https://www.amazon.com/Flojet-Bevjet-Compact-Adapter-approx/dp/B06XPY9CSN) as it is sold options for what fittings you want in our case push in fittings. You can then just simply put your line for the bevjet input into the container and let it sit in the bottom. Or you can modify your container by dirlling out a hole near the base and fitting a [right angle push in stem fitting](https://www.amazon.com/John-Guest-Copolymer-Connect-Fitting/dp/B007COM8TI) inside of it so that you can syphon out as much of the cold brew and not waste it(noone lieks to waste good cold brew). From there you follow the same method and fit the cold brew to a DQC to the in line from the [Bevjet](https://www.amazon.com/Flojet-Bevjet-Compact-Adapter-approx/dp/B06XPY9CSN)

**Nitro Infusion System**
Now this is the meat aand bones of the reason why I made this post. The nitro infusion system. You can go out and spend $600~800 for a completed looking box that you attached to your system and call it a day. But you can also just buy 4 to 5 fittings to do the exact same thing. First the required ones will be an (inline speed control valve)[https://www.grainger.com/product/SMC-In-Line-Speed-Control-Valve-4DGV3?cm_sp=Home-_-MyPurchasedProducts-_-4DGV3&amp;cm_vc=HPMPPZ], T/Y splitter fitting, and 2 (liquid check valve fittings)[https://www.grainger.com/product/JOHN-GUEST-Check-Valve-2JFY8?cm_sp=Home-_-MyPurchasedProducts-_-2JFY8&amp;cm_vc=HPMPPZ]

Arrange them like so:

Line out -&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;- T/Y Splitter -&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; - Check Valve

Column A | Column B | Column C | Column D | Column E
---------|----------|----------|----------|----------
Line out|&lt;&lt;&lt;|T/Y Splitter|&lt;&lt;&lt;|Check Valve
 | |^| | 
 | |Check Valve|&lt;&lt;&lt;|Control Valve

This would be located inside of the box and the smart location to place it would be in between the output of the cold coil and the input of the beer tower/spout.
Side note I forgot to mention you need to run a line of nitrogen gas into the box so be creative on how you want to do it I've explained how to get the cold brew in here so its simple from the manifold that the nitrogen gas spits from the outside.

And then you just adjust the gas with the speed control valve to get a nice creamy texture for the cold brew","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Link to new main post for further discussion

&lt;p&gt;Hi guys,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time posting here. I have a small project I&amp;#39;m working on at work. I&amp;#39;m trying to make some revisions on our cold brew portable jockey box so that it can be used as a near standalone portable nitro kegerator. I&amp;#39;m I am trying to build from scratch something similar to the Kegoutlet&amp;#39;s Nitro Infuser/Micromatic Mininim nitrogen infusion module. I have taken apart both and examined the components and am curious about one part in particular which might be a hitch in the planning phase.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside there is a T union for when the cold brew and the nitrogen blend. I&amp;#39;m curious if a vacuum ejector is what that part is as its pretty bulbous so I don&amp;#39;t have a clear idea on what it could be besides ordering the part and trying it out. And if it was then the mental orientation of the gas/liquid entering the union seems to go against the intended connection points that I would assume vacuum ejectors to opperrate at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is another point of concern that I can figure out down the road. The two bigger questions for this would be in how to eliminate two big pink elephants to make the jockey box standalone. It&amp;#39;s the kegs for the cold brew and the nitrogen tank.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One idea that I am having is to use a Flojet BW5000 to push the cold brew from a holding tank that I can place in the lower shelf of the jockey box and have that entering the infusion module. has anyone tried using the Flojet with anything other than water before and if so what was the results in your attempt.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the nitrogen I was looking up nitrogen pumps/generators that are small scale and I found one from Bunn the Nitron that I can utilize for that. The only concern I would have is that if it could project sufficient pressure. If not I might need to have a fill canister and a regulator somewhere into the build for it which seems likely.&lt;/p&gt;

I have made some interesting observations after some experiments. Note that my way of tasting and technique is nowhere near consistant or scientific but I think it is still interesting.

For 7 days I brewed two cups of Colombia Ibague with a ratio of 18g coffee to 300ml water. I would describe the coffee as roasted nuts with a fruity and acidic finish. One cup is brewed with 01 size v60 and the other 02 size. Grind size medium-fine (14 on Encore). Water is filters with a Britta filter, it is neutral tasting but I think it is not the optimal.

Observations: 01 size has a longer brewing time averaging around 2:30. 02 size is quicker, averaging less than 2:10. And 01 generally tastes less acidic, but have some note of overextraction, a smoky and ashy texture. 02 is smoother, but more acidic, expecially when I get to the bottom of the cup, it is harsh and salty. The difference is noticable.

My theory is that because of the smaller size of 01, it limits the waterflow and cause a more overextracted brew. And somehow I find 01 size filters to be relatively thicker. But I have no scientific way to measure it at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I was never a big fan of coffee until my mid to late 20s.  Never really liked it as a teen and in my 20s for whatever reason one day I got a mocha-chino you know half hot chocolate and half coffee.  Well shortly after this I realized my work had a coffee machine with this choice so I developed a taste for coffee but just a start.  I was so into the sweet taste that if I were to drink a coffee on it's own I would put in at least 5 scoops of sugar but could even do more if I felt like it.  When it came to cream it was just 2 servings of it in my coffee. (or one at Tim Horton's as they use 18% cream and more than one tastes sludgy IMHO).

&amp;#x200B;

My main reason for cutting back on the sugar was actually when I was losing a bunch of weight   I switched my 18% cream to 2% milk and got it down to 3 sugar when was able to cut out the milk.

&amp;#x200B;

Drank 3 sugar for a bit then cut it down to 1.

&amp;#x200B;

That 1 scoop took forever for me to finally kick.  I tried to do it a few times before I was actually able to do it.  It actually feels funny drinking coffee with cream or sugar and I don't like the taste anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I thank anyone for listening and hopefully enjoying my path down the dark path.  I just needed to write it down while I finish my 24OZ cup of black coffee.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does everyone drink their coffee?

Quick shout out to the community for getting me into and guiding me through the world of coffee. It's been a fun and delicious journey.

I have a batch of Ethiopian Yirgacheffe that I roasted myself, City Roast. This morning was the first brew. 

In a v60 for a 300ml cup I would normally set my burr grinder between a 4 and 5 (where smaller is finer). I accidentally left it set to an 8 (slightly courser than midpoint). I made the cup anyways and decided I'd experiment and see how it tasted beside a brew of the typical finer grind size.

I was pretty surprised actually. With all other variables isolated (water off boil, same pour method, same ratio), the finer grind seemed to produce a cup with less flavour. Specifically the courser grind seemed to have a more acidic, citrusy, fruity punch. The finer grind seemed to lose this quality, with maaaybe the addition of some very slight floral tones, but also a seemingly woody aftertaste. Overall less flavour, though.

How would you interpret this? I wouldn't have assumed over extracting could produce less flavour - or the vice versa, under extracting produce more. Is this more citrusy brew simply under extracted and thus more sour?

I’ve brewed it twice so far and and it’s good, but there’s a hint of greatness in it that I’m just not latching on to. 

Here’s my brew setup:

Plastic v60, filtered water (nothing fancy), gooseneck kettle with thermometer, Baratza Encore grinder. “Rao” brew method.

1st brew:
Grind setting 16
Water temp 205F
20g coffee:320ml water
60ml bloom
Total brew time: 2:50

Taste: A bit under extracted, thin, astringent, flavors are evident but muted, short finish.

2nd brew: 
Grind setting 14
(All other variables the same)
Total brew time: 3:15

Taste: More balanced, slightly bitter, chocolate now noticeable, longer finish.

From here I’m open to suggestions. I’d like to try to squeeze a bit more flavor out of this coffee, but I’m not sure what to change next. First thought is to grind even finer, but since this is a medium roast maybe brewing it at a slightly lower temp (say 195F) might work better.

Next, literally all you have to do is get ice from your freezer and put it on top of the grounds. The ice melts at a similar rate that water would drip from a fancy drip tower, providing the same gravity-controlled brew rate.

I'm looking to do cold brew, so I tried a couple test settings past 28 (which the manual had listed for french press), when I saw that they were all producing a good amount finer particles, I just did a batch at 40, the highest setting, hoping that it would be okay.

I ground 3.75oz of whole beans, and got 3.7oz out of it.

This was the result I got: [https://imgur.com/j98cc9e](https://imgur.com/j98cc9e)

I noticed a pretty big mix of larger and smaller particles, so I decided to sift it for a bit, could've gone longer and used a more precise sifter, but for now just used what I had. There was a good amount finer particles that I wouldn't consider usable for cold brew. Also there seemed to be a ton of ""flakey"" pieces as well, I've never really seen that using any other grinder: [https://imgur.com/6gMTSiV](https://imgur.com/6gMTSiV)

I weighed out both amounts, of the usable grounds I got 3.05oz, and the finer particles resulted in .65oz, not exactly the result I was hoping for. The thing was, I probably could've kept sifting, but after a couple minutes I decided to stop there.

Now when I brew, I use the toddy, but also use those single use reusable bags that are made out of corn fiber, I find that they normally work really well with coarse ground coffee, and the double filter from the bag and the toddy filter usually work great. However as I put the bag in to brew, and turned it a couple times to make sure the entire bag and grounds got wet, I noticed there were still a ton of fine particles that leaked out, and instantly made the water look pretty cloudy. This did not really happen when I would fresh grind using the commercial grinder at the grocery store, set at the coarsest  setting. Normally it doesn't get this cloudy that quickly. You can even see some of the sediment that leaked out on the side of the toddy. Here was the result: [https://imgur.com/a2g9meO](https://imgur.com/a2g9meO)

And when I tilt it to see in the light, you can see all the fine particles at the bottom (that isn't noise from the camera): [https://imgur.com/irLrgfv](https://imgur.com/irLrgfv)

Normally when I brew this way, I don't get nearly as many fine particles that leak out. I've even used this exact roast before, ground at the supermarket, and it didn't look like this. I'm still going to give it a shot, and filter it a few more times if necessary, but the toddy filter usually does a decent job. but if any sludge or anything gets produced I know that can pass through the filter.

I have recently purchased a Chemex, Aeropress, Encore, and a gooseneck variable temp Bonavita kettle for making coffee in the morning. I don't have much experience, and I did a trial run last night with some older beans that I've had sitting in my cupboard for a year or two. 

1. When a recipe calls for 17g of coffee, for example, do you measure 17g of beans, grind them, and use those grounds in the recipe? Or do you grind a slightly larger amount and then measure 17g from that? 

2. Is there any harm in leaving the encore on for longer than necessary? Occasionally I had times where the one last bean was still swirling around like something circling the drain and I wasn't sure if I was doing any damage to the grinder by kind of just letting it run. 

3. My first attempt at an aeropress brew was using the traditional right-side up method. The recipe had me fill the vessel to the ""4"" line. I know it's normal for water to seep through the filter while pouring, but is it normal for the mug to be almost half full by the time I put the plunger in to create the seal? I then did another round with the upside down method which of course doesn't have this problem as much. 

4. So what's the deal with square chemex filters? I bought some not really knowing how to fold them, and I definitely did it wrong the first time. Do you just fold it into quarters, and put the corner that's the center at the square down into the vessel, and then take one of the leaves in the corner and make a cone out of that? 

Thanks. I know this would probably be more suitable for tomorrow's free talk thread but I thought I would ask now while it's all still on my mind.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a recipe calls for 17g of coffee, for example, do you measure 17g of beans, grind them, and use those grounds in the recipe? Or do you grind a slightly larger amount and then measure 17g from that? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there any harm in leaving the encore on for longer than necessary? Occasionally I had times where the one last bean was still swirling around like something circling the drain and I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if I was doing any damage to the grinder by kind of just letting it run. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first attempt at an aeropress brew was using the traditional right-side up method. The recipe had me fill the vessel to the &amp;quot;4&amp;quot; line. I know it&amp;#39;s normal for water to seep through the filter while pouring, but is it normal for the mug to be almost half full by the time I put the plunger in to create the seal? I then did another round with the upside down method which of course doesn&amp;#39;t have this problem as much. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s the deal with square chemex filters? I bought some not really knowing how to fold them, and I definitely did it wrong the first time. Do you just fold it into quarters, and put the corner that&amp;#39;s the center at the square down into the vessel, and then take one of the leaves in the corner and make a cone out of that? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks. I know this would probably be more suitable for tomorrow&amp;#39;s free talk thread but I thought I would ask now while it&amp;#39;s all still on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

I bought some beans from a roaster recently that were a medium roast. Whenever I get pour over at a shop it is always typically a light roast coffee- but I have read that you can use medium roasts as well.

I've typically use light roast Ethiopian coffee for my pour overs- 18 grams of coffee to make 8-10 ounces of coffee in 2.5 minutes. I'm playing around with this Brazilian medium roast a bit- I find it is more palatable when it is a courser grain and a longer bloom time- so my total brew time is roughly 3.5 minutes.

The only source I found online was saying that medium roast pour over would have a quicker brew time than a light roast- if I exclude my bloom time that is true since my grind is more coarse, but I'm still unsure about the whole process- looking for a bit of guidance if anyone has any recommendations for pour over with a medium roast","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

I have some Brazilian pea berry (And Sidamo) that I have roasted to numerous different levels.  I make the coffee with a Chemex.  

I boil the water in a tea pot and then turn it off and let it cool for about 30 seconds.

I have tried using 40 grams of coffee up to 60 grams of coffee (for 900 grams of water.)

I have tried using paper filter, and metal filter. 

I have tried using the lighter roasts and the darker roasts.

I have tried course grind to fine grind. 

Same thing seems to happen every time... the coffee tastes pretty good but the more it cools the more nasty it gets.  By the time it's room temperature I can't even take a drink without making a face like I just had a shot of whiskey.  

I'm not very keen on being able to tell if it's bitter or sour...I understand the concepts in my head but I can't tell the difference :) 

Any idea what I can try?


EDIT: I'm an idiot....!  I tested the temp of the water after 30 seconds and it was still at 210.  I let it cool to 190 and now the (I'm assuming bitter) flavor is completely gone.

Did you/Should I attend coffee school? (I have the option of attending UCC Coffee Academy)

Did you/Should I read one book first and then used that to learn the next step? (I was thinking of starting with Coffee Atlas. Or maybe Craft Coffee though I don't know, humbly speaking, if the author is qualified to write about coffee and I want to prevent learning something I have to UNLEARN later.)

Which method did you/should I start with? (Espresso? V60? which I have read, watched videos about, but have no clue if it's a good starting point to learn about coffee)

What equipment/kit did you/should I start with? (I don't mind spending on equipment that will last me a decade or that I will use throughout my learning journey)

If you could redo your journey, where would you have started? What would you have done differently? What kit/gear would you have gotten? What would be a great jumping off point? Where did you waste time or resources in?

I've had my Breville Grinder Pro for ~2 years and it seemed to be doing great. It got to a point where it wasn't dispensing grounds, but after a quick air compressor blast it was back to grinding like a pro!

I went to a nice new coffee house and got a pour-over cup and was blown away.. I immediately ordered a chemex and some special coffee.

I tried grinding the coffee and it took forever for any coffee to come out of the Breville. Shaking etc didn't seem to help.

Lots of googling later and I learned that the impeller can wear down and fail to push the coffee out, but someone designed a 3D printed part to replace it. After getting the impeller out, I saw that I could wedge pieces of cut up straw between the metal impeller shield and the plastic impeller to extend the impeller slightly. Sweet! 

It definitely worked to clear the coffee grounds, but things were still slow! It looked like the chute was clogging.

I saw a video of Burr grinder cleaner beans and ordered some. They shot right through the grinder - success! I put some beans in, and tries grinding... It worked at first, but soon grounds would only flow on the coarsest setting. On the fine setting it sounded like the burrs were touching.

I tried changing the adjustable Burr to coarser, but the same problem (slightly better maybe?). I have no idea how the burr could move and get tighter, or how removing and replacing the burr could screw up it's height (its screwed on snug)...

At this rate I'm suuuuper frustrated with this thing and ready to call it quits. I'm going to call Breville tomorrow and see if they'll replace it, but preparing to buy a new (DIFFERENT) grinder.

Still with me? Great! Does anyone have suggestions for a durable, reliable grinder?

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had my Breville Grinder Pro for ~2 years and it seemed to be doing great. It got to a point where it wasn&amp;#39;t dispensing grounds, but after a quick air compressor blast it was back to grinding like a pro!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to a nice new coffee house and got a pour-over cup and was blown away.. I immediately ordered a chemex and some special coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried grinding the coffee and it took forever for any coffee to come out of the Breville. Shaking etc didn&amp;#39;t seem to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of googling later and I learned that the impeller can wear down and fail to push the coffee out, but someone designed a 3D printed part to replace it.

My problem is that after replacing the cylinder sleeve inside my group head I'm getting low volume, frothy shots.  It feels like the piston seals are not sealing properly.  I have replaced the seals and lubricated well with food-grade lubricant.

The replacement cylinder does not appear to be uniform diameter inside - see picture.

It was not divided into a top and bottom; rather it was a single metal vessel with a narrower centre and a lid. You'd open the lid and inside was a sort of conical pod with a handle; the narrow centre of the vessel was threaded, and the pod was screwed into it. 

To work the pot you'd unscrew the pod and lift it out whole, then pour water in the now-accessible bottom section of the vessel. You'd then unscrew the two halves of the pod to find the filter inside. You'd fill that with coffee, screw the pod back together, screw that back into the vessel and brew. The coffee would accumulate on top of the pod, from which you'd pour it.

It was a bit expensive and at the time I was in the middle of a house move and had already enough random crap kicking around, plus it was large - at least a six-cup - and I don't usually brew so much coffee, so I didn't buy it. Needless to say, it's a decision I've regretted ever since.

I never saw such a moka again, and I'd never seen it before. Do you have any idea what it was?

I should mention that this happened in Italy, where there's a sort of fetish for mokas and odd-looking ones aren't a rare sight - but looks are all they differ in, while this one had a genuinely different mechanic.

I have put my thoughts/assumptions next to each item on my list so please correct me if I am way off on any of them. 

For espresso machines I am considering the following (in order of preference): 
* Used (from the 80's)  La Pavoni Europiccola (I love the aesthetics and the manual nature but otherwise aren't these lacking in temperature control?)  
* Lelit Anna (with PID) &amp; Breville Infuser (To me these seem the same as the below options but with more insight into temperature and pressure, so it seems better....am I wrong here?)  
* Gaggia Classic &amp; Rancilio Silvia (These seem to be basic with very little control and insight into the pressure and temperature. If I am trying to learn how to pull a better shot these seem less than ideal, no?)  
* Crossland CC1 (In my uneducated opinion this seems comparable to the Lelit Anna I just prefer the aesthetics of the lelit &amp; Breville :) )  

I have been trying to teach myself a lot about grinders without actually using one but will the Baratza Sette 30 do the job for me when paired with one of the above? Or should I realy upgrade to the 270? What concerns me here is how much people stress how important it is yet how difficult it seems to distinguish various models once you get above the $200-300 price point.

Additional Info if you want it:  
* I rarely ever use a steam wand.   
* I don't have a specific price in mind but I really just want to get the best value for my money and something that I can properly increase my skills with.  
* Usually only pulling 1-2 shots at a time (so not worried about the la pavoni volume limitations)  
* Would need a grinder that can also grind for regular coffee (though could care less about the quality of that). 
* I've been using a low level delonghi for past 2 years which I recently discovered isn't the ""true"" espresso that I am after. This was exacerbated by the slow decline of the pressure output.

The ""pro"" side argues that the hot water helps to prevent bacteria build up on the inside of the steam wand, and also that some of the hot water gets sucked up into the wand throughout the shift, helping to keep the wand clean throughout the day. I've definitely noticed a good amount of hot water spewing out when we purge after even just 5 mins of soaking. The dissenting side says that wiping the exterior is enough throughout the day, and the wands only need to be soaked as part of our closing procedure, which also seems reasonable. 

From my research online I can't really decide either way, and these machines are very expensive so I want to do everything in my power to keep them running properly and serving great drinks for as long as possible, any insight is appreciated.

The sequence?

Why this works: as you pull the shot, the water is continuously churning with temperatures in the ~209°F range. The caramel dissolves and is then introduced to the rest of the liquid. At this point, the flavor of the shot is preserved, with some sweetness added. My theory is that the caramel will overpower the intricacies of the shot, which is why you add the water on top.

So most of the time I made coffee with my Moka pot, it tasted bitter and pretty much like very concentrated drip coffee. 

The first times I just put water in the pot, then coffee on the coffee basket (sorry, don't know England very best) and then screw the top and put it on the stove on medium heat. Couldn't say I was satisfied with the result.

I tried to change the temperature to low. Still didn't do much, although sometimes coffee did taste like espresso a little bit. But apparently this wasn't the trick I was looking for.

Which means, googling time! I looked up what I shall do. Most forums and videos said I should use already boiling water. So I did. Flavour improved like a lot, but it was still much too bitter.

Next time, I thought that maybe I was leaving it on the heat for too long. I used to leave it on the heat until there was just foam coming out and not much coffee. So this time, I put the pot off the heat as soon as the coffee coming out turned into a blonde colour.

Best coffee I've ever had.

Flavour improved dramatically. Every sip I took was leaving a long lasting aroma in my nostrils. And bitterness was also lowered a lot.

So that's what I had to do all this time. Just remove the Moka pot from the heat as soon as coffee coming out was lighter in colour, even before any foam was pouring.

From now on, I think I know what to do. Put boiling water in the pot and turn off the heat early.

So that's it. I wanted to share my coffee brewing experience because I am surprised and excited!

I have been reading this subreddit for a few days but the options are absolutely overwhelming, and I would love advice/input.

I know none of these options will give me the \*perfect\* espresso, but I am not in the place to be especially picky, anyway.I also have space restraints because I share a tiny kitchen with 5 people.

Also, I have not really looked into aeropresses, french presses, and pretty much anything other than the options listed below, so please let me know if you think something else would better suit my needs! Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

**OPTION 1:**I think I'm leaning the most toward the Bialetti stainless steel Kitty moka pot ($40). (I need a stainless steel option because my stovetop is induction). I know this technically doesn't make espresso, but it seems most people find the taste comparable enough for a faux-latte.I think I would be purchasing the 4-cup model, but it also comes in 2, 6, and 10. Any advice on that? I am making 1, maybe 2 lattes at a time, and I assume a latte would be ""2 cups""?

&amp;#x200B;

**OPTION 2:**During all this reading, I've been getting advertisements for the Wacaco Nanopresso portable espresso maker ($65). It operates with a pump piston, and I think the big draw for the product is that it's entirely portable and needs no energy source except for your two hands. For me, though, this would probably never leave the kitchen. I have an electric kettle so heating the water would not be an issue.It makes one shot of espresso at a time, unless I purchase the Barista Kit accessory ($33) which allows for double shots.It does make ""real espresso,"" though, so is it worth the extra money and single-shot limitation?

&amp;#x200B;

**OPTION 3:**Lastly, I've seen a few people just recommend cheap espresso makers, like the De'Longhi EC155 ($95). This includes a milk steamer/frother, too, so I wouldn't need to buy one separately. Is it worthwhile to buy a machine like this for so cheap, or is it that cheap for a reason? Are there other machines anyone would recommend over this one? Note: I don't like the concept of pods so I'd rather stray away from pod-based systems, and counter space is also a precious resource for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance for helping me out in my pursuit of a somewhat acceptable latte replacement! I have done a fair amount of research at this point but I still find this entire coffee hobby so overwhelming and confusing, so I appreciate anyone willing to help me out :)

&lt;p&gt;Right now I just either order speciality coffee pre ground from the roaster, or when a good whole bean is available at my grocery store I just use the big industrial grinder set to the coarsest setting (but the options are really limited). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing I will say is that I eventually might get into making my own espresso over time since I really like that as well, but not sure if I should just buy speciality equipment for that, or if there is a grinder that is good enough for both. Baratza encore and virtuoso seem to be popular here, but not sure if it&amp;#39;s worth spending that much on a grinder now if it won&amp;#39;t do espresso that well in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m needing some insight as to why an Aeropress recipe didn’t work out for me this morning.

My usual daily go-to recipe is below, as Recipe 1.
I do this recipe twice for a double (*360g’s of coffee*), so it takes me about 10 mins total from start to finish. Aside from the time it takes, I love it.

This morning I tried brewing all 32g’s of coffee in one go (*see Recipe 2 below*), to hopefully save myself 4 or 5 mins. But the cup came out under-extracted and kind of watered down.

I was under the impression that increasing the ratio of coffee to water, then topping it off with water after plunging should accomplish the same result. 
Is anyone able to shed some light on why it may have gone wrong?

&amp;nbsp;

**Recipe 1:**

-	Brew Style: Inverted Aeropress
-	Coffee: 16g, medium-darker roast
-	Grind size: setting #30 on Encore, 6.5 on hand grind
-	Water: 180g @ 200°F
-	Brew time: 4:00

**Instructions:**

1.	Pour 100g of water over grinds, stir
2.	Bloom for 30 secs, stir
3.	Pour remaining 80g water, stir
4.	Put the filter on, and steep for 3:30
5.	20-30 sec plunge at 4:00 into preheated mug
6.	Repeat all steps to make it a double

&amp;nbsp;

**Recipe 2:**

-	Brew Style: Inverted Aeropress
-	Coffee: 32g, medium-darker roast
-	Grind size: setting #30 on Encore, 6.5 on hand grind
-	Water: 360g @ 200°F
-	Brew time: 4:00

**Instructions:**

1.	Pour 120g of water over grinds, stir
2.	Bloom for 30 secs, stir
3.	Pour 80g water, stir
4.	Put the filter on, and steep for 3:30

1. What size moka pot should I get? I only drink one cup in the morning, but I'd like to be able to make a cup for someone else on occasion. I've heard it's better to get the smallest size that fits your needs, so maybe I should get a 3-cup and then just use it twice if I have a guest? I've also heard that a 6 cup actually ends up only making 1-2 cups for some people, due to some of it ending up as the ""waste"" watery coffee at the bottom. So maybe that one is the way to go? Idk.

2. What gadgets do I need to froth milk? I want something that's inexpensive but makes a good dense foam. I was looking at the PowerLix electric wand. But I've never frothed milk before, so I'm not sure how to heat up the milk before hand. Do I need any extra tools, or should I get something else entirely?

3. I'm going to start with the Bialetti pregrounds until I get more experience and can grind my own beans properly. For those of you who have tried it, which is the better flavor? Or if you have other preground recommendations for Moka that would be great too! I prefer bold/rich flavors over mellow ones, as long as they are not too bitter and can be complemented by the sweetness of milk. 

4. Lastly, I've heard that using a Moka is very much trial and error, and you just have to figure out what works for you. There's so much advice out there, so if anyone wants to put in their two cents here for a beginner like me I'd welcome the advice.

Something with a small footprint. I mostly only need to make 1-2 cups at a time but I do like cold brew as well, so not always. I don't like waste and that includes wasted coffee grinds.

Is good espresso something that's only for the wealthy and large kitchen-ed? I don't mind spending a few grand, but I need to renovate my kitchen first (at which point, a few grand is nothing, so perfect), but is there a smaller option? This is the one component I'd be willing to have a temporary thing for, as I would happily choose a nice one as part of my renovation.

A scale. I have a kitchen scale I'd already like to replace so if there's something that would work for baking \*and\* coffee, I'd be thrilled. Is that a thing?

Something new, like a V60, Chemex, whatever. What goes well with an Aeropress? Basically, what should I be doing to drink coffee? I've read hundreds of threads on this board but it really makes me feel overwhelmed, all the options. Just tell me what to do/buy. Shopping with someone else's money is always fun, right? :)

It's annoying that I'm not giving a real budget, but it's because I don't have one. I want the best but don't want to spend needlessly/beyond my needs.

I just tried some lighter roast “special coffee” that is supposed to be a very delicious type.

I have brewed it 3 times and all three times it is incredibly unsatisfying, it is weak and tastes sour. Am i brewing it wrong or is it supposed to taste like that? I brew it in the same proportions and way as I brew dark roast (local large scale roaster’s premium freshly roasted beans) but at higher temperatures since that is what I have read lighter roasts are supposed to brew at.

The only time I ever have tried light roast before was starbucks blonde roast at starbucks and that was a horrible experience, it felt almost like coffee flavored water with a texture similar to tea, not the smooth, nutty and dry flavour like im used to with much less acidity. 

I might do it wrong or maybe it is just not for me.

Update: Tried some of your ideas, increased the amount of coffee, grinded two steps finer (0.06mm tighter), made sure to keep the water as hot as possible and brewed, much better, but still crap. Now it tastes like bad coffee instead of coffee scented water, it has very similar character to a bag of preground darkroast that had been open for a year.

Will go to a cafe that I know has some good baristas and hopefully the same coffee or similar so that I can know if im just horrible at brewing or this coffee is awful. Most likely my brewing skills that is the problem.

I’m looking to bring some of the experience of brewing fresh coffee at the office. I currently brew coffee at home with a breville dual boiler and tend to buy small batch coffees + I’m currently subscribed to a variety of different small batch roasters. 

 Current office situation: I share a cubicle with another colleague, so space is limited and I want to be conscious about sound/mess + I wouldn’t be able to have a setup in the pantry. 

I’ve been thinking that a kettle + French press would probably do the trick, and I can grind the beans at home and bring them. But would love to hear your office coffee setups that you have created/ works for you in a somewhat constricted environment. 

I’m trying to stay away from pods as I have a bad impression on their freshness, impact to the environment (but I may be completely wrong about the freshness? Maybe there’s good stuff out there that I just don’t know about). 

Also open to some semi-automatic slim machines under $200 like the De’longhi ec155 - but it doesn’t seem to have very good reviews so I’m on the fence.

It doesn't seem to be working well with my usual method, which is an 18g Melodrip pulse pour recipe. I've had a lot of luck with this recipe for a few coffees now, namely a lactic process Colombian, and a Honey Process El Salvador (Brandywine Coffee and Onyx respectively). However, this bag under similar parameters simply feels dull. I keep going finer to extend the brew time a bit, and it doesn't matter how much longer it extracts, it just continues to be lifeless. 

Which got me to thinking this could be channeling. So my question is: If you seem to be getting a flavor usually reserved for underextraction (watery, weak, dull, no finish) even though you are well into the realm of medium fine (probably approaching fine), would that be a fairly clear indicator of channeling? Due to excess fines?

Going coarser feels wrong, but if I'm channeling, I suppose it would actually make my coffee taste better.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a new bag (Colombia Narino Washed), and it&amp;#39;s stumping me a bit. It doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be working well with my usual method, which is an 18g Melodrip pulse pour recipe. I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of luck with this recipe for a few coffees now, namely a lactic process Colombian, and a Honey Process El Salvador (Brandywine Coffee and Onyx respectively). However, this bag under similar parameters simply feels dull. I keep going finer to extend the brew time a bit, and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter how much longer it extracts, it just continues to be lifeless. &lt;/p&gt;

-	Chemex with bleached circular filters

-	16-16.6 brew ratio

-	Brita filtered water (I drink this filtered water with almost every meal and have no problems)

-	Pour with effort to have grounds even on sides [like this](https://i.imgur.com/CTPQp5S.jpg)

Edit: Final verdict! 


First of all, thank you all for the precious opinions! I have considered all your points of view, and, despite a strong love for Aergrind and Lido, I have concluded that my final pick would be Timemore or Kinu. 

Both of them caught my eye because of the industrial design which is important to me (in addition to grind quality obviously), Timemore Slim because it’s prefect for the aeropress especially as a potential travel/office combo, and Kinu M47 because it’s the most future proof for all scenarios (such as if I decide to make espresso) so that I don’t need to upgrade again. 

Now out of these two... I feel like both of them answer my need, in two different ways (the portability vs more excellence), and I think that it can even make sense to actually own both (just like some of you own an aergrind for the office and a lido for home for instance). But at the moment, with my budget, Timemore might be more reasonable. 

I was saying, at first, that I didn’t want to have to upgrade again after a couple of years or so, so I am a bit contradicting myself by considering Timemore over Kinu, but I’m realising that getting a Kinu later on wouldn’t mean the Timemore would be in vain. I would still be able to continue using them both, just in different situations.

I was coming from the Kitchenaid burr grinder which was very large, very heavy, and $250. 

After reading here it seemed this was the best burr grinder you could get under the $500 mark more or less (I know there are a few other manuals that are just as good or a tad better depending on who you ask..... but this group of 3-4 is best burr under $500). Especially if you’re after electric you’d be up into the $500+ range. Guess that’s not really an issue but honestly I sort of wanted to try a manual.... glutton for punishment I guess. Anyways... to the thoughts....

* I was shocked at the construction of it. Very sturdy. Very large. Feels super top notch not 100% plastic as I was expecting. 

* it’s large. I regularly do cold brew do being able to grind 70g+ was a must for me. 

* Dialing in the grind is insanely easy. I read folks getting the rings stuck, etc and honestly I’m just not sure how you get them stuck if you just take 5 seconds and slow down a bit. 

* the static free grind jar is fantastic. The Kitchenaid glass jar was full of static and a nightmare. 

* Manually grinding is not as easy as folks say. I do 40g every morning and it probably takes less than 1 minute (never timed me) it’s not like super insanely you don’t notice easy.... it’s a tad bit of work. 

* The uniformed grind and great cups this is producing makes the bit of labor 100% worth it IMO

Overall I’m very pleased with the grind compared to the Kitchenaid and have no regrets with the purchase even with the manual effort it takes to grind. I find making my coffee in the morning as a bit of a therapeutic ritual and really enjoy this extra bit of involvement. If you’re goal is to get it made ASAP and out the door though, honestly you probably ought to save and get an electric as after a couple months I bet you will be over it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picked up a Lido 3 a few weeks ago.... my first manual grinder.

I'm currently using the Hario slim grinder which is apparently notoriously *not good* for pour over. I am having to grind coarse resulting in a heavily under extracted (sour) brew. When I increment the grinder only one step from the medium-coarse setting the grind is full of fines and gives me a sludgy coffee bed at the end of the drawdown which makes the coffee far too bitter as I'm guessing it's over extracted. I can't find an ""in between"" setting on the Hario grinder, it's ruining my morning with terrible brews! I've tried several different types/brands of beans and I get the same outcome every time.

So, is anybody able to recommend a better quality grinder specifically for pour over where I won't run into this same problem? I'm not exactly looking to spend a lot of money - I can't afford anything high-end like a Lido or whatnot. I'd like to get another hand grinder as it's more quiet but I wouldn't be opposed to an electric grinder if it's better value.

Hi all, 

I was considering ""making"" my own water because I already have baking soda and food grade epsom salts lying around and can get distilled water very easy. I have one 1L bottle (wide mouth nalgene) and a Jennings CJ4000 scale (so only accurate to 0.5g but I can't imagine being off by 0.2g in mineral would make a huge difference.... right?)

I was going to try out recipe 4. Just so I have this clear-- I do what is said in the methods section and make a solution of 1.68g/1L baking soda and 2.45g/1L epsom salt, and then pour (e.g. recipe 4) 40.1g of the solution of (1.68/1L) baking soda and 80.7g of the (2.45g/1L) epsom salt solution into 879.2g of distilled water..... right? The wording has me little confused.

On another note, **would the recipe be ruined if I adding the baking soda and epsom salts into the same 1L container before adding that mixture into the distilled water** or would it still be viable? Also to reiterate I'd only be accurate to about half a gram rather than a hundredth. My Brita water tastes good but I'm on a coffee-bender and am really obsessing so I can't imagine that this would make a huge difference in my brew.... which is also why I want to test it out ;)

Now I have noticed that this is not always the case and there are cafes out there that successfully uses light roasts in their espresso beverages without causing sourness in the process. So my question is, how do you fix the sourness that is associated with light roasted espresso? Is the solution the same as solving underextracted espresso which is by grinding finer and increasing extraction or is there some other method that experienced baristas typically use to balance the overpowering acidity of the light roast?&lt;/p&gt;

Worst of all, I got the pot fairly recently.

First of all, I don't wash it right after brewing coffee. The reason why is that the pot is still very hot for a lot of time after boiling water, so I let it cool firstly, then I forget about it and then I either wash it in the afternoon or completely ignore it and wash it the next morning right before I brew another cup of coffee. And I wash it with plain water and maybe use a sponge.

Moreover, when I wash it right before using it, I, kind of obviously, assemble it and use it wet. I don't let it dry firstly.

And, I don't know if it matters but I don't remove the rubber band between the top part and the bottom. It's hard to remove anyway so I leave it there.

So far I've noticed that at the bottom of the water tank, there are several tiny dark spots of rust, aluminium oxide, which are impossible to remove. I don't know if this is going to affect the taste of the coffee in the long run and I don't know how to remove them. Furthermore, there's rust under the rubber band, but common sense says that this won't affect the taste of the coffee. But I don't know the effects on the pot itself.

What shall I do? How do I accelerate the cooling of the pot to wash it up immediately after using it? How should I clean up the part under the rubber band, since it's very difficult to remove? Is plain water sufficient? Will the rusty spots affect the taste, or are they a health hazard? How can I remove them? I have so many questions and I'm concerned...

I'm new here. I wanted to invest in a good Semi automatic espresso machine. During my research there was talked a lot about the american brands but I have a bit difficulty finding the equivalents in europe.

These are the choices I could end up with:  [https://www.coolblue.nl/en/coffee-machines/espresso-machines/semi-automatic-espresso-machines/topnotch-build-quality](https://www.coolblue.nl/en/coffee-machines/espresso-machines/semi-automatic-espresso-machines/topnotch-build-quality) 

My eyes fell on the [Solis Grind &amp; Infuse Pro 115A Black](https://www.coolblue.nl/en/product/605188/solis-grind-infuse-pro-115-silver.html) (which seems similar to the breville infuser?) Would this be a good choice? 

And a second question. I guess the grinder on that machine isn't perfect. Should I also go for a Baratza Sette 270 or something similar?

I just ordered a Timemore slim from a local reseller (not directly from alibaba) and I am having second thoughts on the quality of the burr set that comes along with it.

The problem I'm having is the top (static) burr has some nasty bite marks. The lower one looks OK.

First off, thank you all for providing such valuable information, this sub has changed the way i view coffee in a very positive way.   Without getting into a sob-fest; I’ve had a rough couple of months and I really value my caffeine more then ever!  I am looking to maximize my AM coffee without breaking the bank.  

Background info:

I own a “higher level” Keurig (from about 2-3 years ago, paid a few hundred dollars for it but I’m not 100% sure which model it is).  I now realize this was not the greatest coffee purchase, but I’m stuck with it and am not financially able to get anything else at this point.    I have a reusable k cup thingy and I “batch brew” my coffee for the week into a pitcher because I only really like cold coffee so I make a couple of 18 ounce cups into the pitcher then it goes into the fridge.  The coffee is decent but not great.  One thing I’ve started doing (thanks to this sub!!!) is buying whole bean coffee and grinding it at Trader Joe’s and that has really improved things a lot.   

Can anyone think of anything small I can do to improve the coffee I make in the morning?  Right now I can only afford maybe $7-8 bucks a week for coffee and creamer, but I would totally be willing to re-allocate that money for buying some supplies one week if it would make my morning brew better.  I know this all sounds trivial, but some days my coffee is the highlight of my day, so I really appreciate you even taking the time to read this far!!!! 


My sincerest apologies if this has already been posted, I tried to search through the subs and rules to no avail but I’m just so... tired... even if someone is able to direct me to a post where this has already been covered that would be amazing.

I've recently joined the ranks of coffee-enthousiasts by buying a proper machine (solis triple heat). I'm a chef and have been drinking proper coffee for years at work, but somehow never got around to getting a machine myself.I  had a lot of fun for about a week or so, figuring out how to get the perfect shot. What a great hobby!  


Then I changed beans, and it alllll went down from there and I can't figure out what's wrong! I've been searching google for a solution but I'm finding it quite hard to get a satisfying answer, so I figured I tried asking redditors!

This is what's been going on:  
As said, I was doing alright until I bought some new beans. I was aware that with new beans I would probably have to re-adjust my grinder and stuff. However, my first shot with these new beans was actually quite fine!

After that, for some reason I could not get the pressure up anymore. Even though I used the same amount of coffee, weighted and all, the water was just flowing out. Pressure was below 5 bar.  
Okay so, I probably do something wrong myself right? That first correct coffee was just a fluke.  
So since then I've been adjusting and adjusting. I probably used too low of a pressure while temping, adjusted to a finer grind, etc etc.   
I just made a coffee and it got to 8 bar, so better, still not perfect. I also got like 60ml of coffee.  


So here come my questions:  
\- Does the type of bean make THIS much difference?  
\- Does the amount of pressure of the machine make this much difference (1 bar off but still twice the amount of coffee) or is there something wrong?  
\- What else can be a factor? There's the amount of coffee, type of grind, proper temping. I can go into the advanced settings of the machine and adjust volume water used instead of seconds, maybe a good idea?    
\- Any advice you can give overall?  


Another thing is my girlfriend tried making coffee before all this stuff and said it was kinda hard for her to lock the piston (is that the english word as well?). The coffee was like this after that happened. Did she maybe force something and broke it? I figured there was probably no way that could happen (she would just stop trying) but since I still can't get it right I'm starting to wonder. I hiiiighly doubt this and I'm probably just too much a rookie to understand what I'm doing wrong. I tested the pressure by cleaning the machine with a blind filter and it worked fine. Still, thought I'd mention it.

Hope you guys can help out!

My first year, I'd visit my favourite local place every few days and play around with the baristas:

1. Meditating before drinking to make myself really present, then continuing to mediate on the coffee's flavour.
2. Slurping coffee like wine tasters, breathing in air and make a sucking noise.  I felt like an idiot at first, but the baristas were doing it so...
3. Trying different beans side-by-side, especially espressos
4. Trying the same coffee with different brew methods side-by-side (espresso vs aeropress vs v60, for example)  I'd point at random machines on the shelf and say things like ""can you make me one with that thing?""  I got into pour overs because I like fruity coffees.
5. Also, trying the same bean in different espresso extraction volumes side-by-side - like regular, ristretto and 6ml ""bullet shot"" which Ivo Papalski at Dabov showed me.  You will make a Zoolander face. :)
6. I'd bring exotic fruits to share with the baristas. Then we'd play with different coffees and brews to find flavours that weren't listed on the pack. 
7. Taking a sip only every few minutes, to notice the taste difference as the temperature changes.  Turns out this was a big one for me, and I'd sense some tastes get stronger or weaker as it cooled.  Sometimes, tastes would just appear and disappear.
8. Tasting with the SCA flavour wheel in front of me ([https://sca.coffee/research/coffee-tasters-flavor-wheel](https://sca.coffee/research/coffee-tasters-flavor-wheel) ) \*points\* ""Oh, I taste that!""

Having said that, I’d like to share with you all my recipe for a V60 and get your opinions on what you think about it. As you’ll notice in my instructions, I’ve taken elements from Hoffman’s method and incorporated them into the 4:6 method and I really think it works well with the lighter roasted coffees I generally go for:

1. Start off with 20g freshly roasted coffee (ideally less than 2 weeks from roast date) to 300g filtered water (205-208°F or right off boil)
2. Grind coffee medium-fine,  ̶a̶b̶o̶u̶t̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶s̶a̶m̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶a̶r̶s̶e̶n̶e̶s̶s̶ slightly coarser than what Hoffman recommends for his technique
3. Rinse paper filter in V60, pre heat brewer, discard water from carafe.
4. Optional: Put the kettle back on stovetop after rinsing paper filter to bring water back to boil
5. Pour in coffee, make a well with your finger in the coffee bed
6. Start timer and gently pour 2x coffee dose as water to bloom for 45 seconds (up to 3x coffee dose if needed)
7. Swirl your brewer to make sure the water and coffee are evenly mixed
8. At 45 seconds pour enough water in small concentric circles until scale reads 120g
9. Pour 60g water @ 1:30 (180g total)
10. Pour 60g water @ 2:15 (240g total)
11. Pour 60g water @ 3:00 (300g final weight;  drawdown completes @ 3:30)

Note: water should completely drain between each pour. If it doesn’t you might want to go a bit coarser on your grind.  

Note 2: You will also notice in this method that your coffee bed will not be flat in the end. Even though Hofmann and others stress that the bed should be flat, Tetsu has mentioned that it is not necessary for his method.

I hope some of you will try this method out and tell me if it works for you as well.

So I recently got into making my own cold brew at home. I bought an inexpensive grinder and a the Filtron cold brewing rig. It's been wonderful, but it's not enough. I love in a house of 6 adults who almost all drink it. 

With the amount we go through, I'm thinking about making at least a gallon (of concentrate) at a time. Maybe two even. 

Here's my plan:

Brewista Cold Pro 4 (3.5 gal unit) with 2.5lbs coffee and 1.5 gallons water. Steep 16 hours. I currently use my Filtron at max capacity (12oz coffee / 56oz water) and the 2.5lbs / 1.5gal is just about the same ratio.

The big wild card for me right now is the grinder. The one I'm using currently (Capresso 560) runs on a timer dial, and it takes 3 full dial turns to grind a 12oz bag. Grinding 40oz that way sounds like hell. I'd love to find something I could set to grind 1-5lbs, walk away and come back to ground coffee. I'd love to get one that's anti static.

Seems to be a lot of people who hate it because “it doesn’t work” and everyone else who likes it “even though it’s not as good as a real machine”. Accurate summary?

I can sort of see where both perspectives are coming from, especially if people are trying to use it “as recommended”. Certainly did my head in for a while, especially as it seemed clear early on that standard config/recipes just weren’t doing it for me.

But finally a breakthrough! I’m now consistently getting fantastic full-quality zero-compromise shots out of it, so I thought I should add a comment now (I think) I’ve got something to add.

First, the changes. Naked portafilter (Rok), ridgeless 51mm La Pavoni basket, and a 51mm distribution tool (OCD-style). Ditched the tamper (more on that shortly).

Recipe: 19g in (very fine grind, 6 by default on my Breville Smart Grinder Pro), 42-45g out, in 28-35 seconds. Water off the boil, with two blank shots through the stock portafilter first to warm it up, then swap in the naked. Fill to 3/4cm below the very top, lift the arms, count to ten, then press firmly but steadily until the target weight is reached (noting the time is in range too). Espresso cup is on a stand on the scales so it sits just below the portafilter with enough clearance to view the shot. No tamp, as the distributor is set to an equivalent depth that after a few spins each way it’s fully seated in the basket with equivalent compaction of the puck, but with perfect consistency (I do give a few vertical taps and then a swirl first to settle the loose grinds). Oh, and yeah, use an Aeropress funnel to load the portafilter!

Crema is consistently rich, espresso itself is consistently smooth and balanced, and the tasting notes come through nice and clear. I’ve paid good money in good specialty cafes and received good espressos that were not quite where the Rok can go now I’ve got it dialled in.

To be very clear, it took a LOT of experimenting, far more than most people probably have the patience for. But it absolutely paid off. Quality beans are worth it, and freshness is essential. Shot time is a pretty good indicator for grind adjustments too - one experiment used beans from a different roaster, but roasted same day, that were a little lighter, and sure enough the shot time dropped just a touch, as you’d expect, for the lighter roast.

The basket change is probably one of the best upgrades you can make for quality/consistency, coupled with the distributor. The stock basket means the distributor doesn’t go deep enough to really be useful, and changing the basket was the big breakthrough overall. Previously, excessive acidity was a chronic problem, but it’s gone now and not an issue at all. 

It’s not a forgiving device if everything isn’t “just right”, but it’s supremely capable of delivering top-shelf espresso when handled right. One of the joys of manual espresso, right?! All up, I’m 100% satisfied with it now I’ve got it sorted, and happy I didn’t give up. :-) I’m still dubious of it’s use in a commercial context, but cup-for-cup I would absolutely put against any semi-auto - maybe the ROK wouldn’t win, but it’d put up a damn good fight even so, and stand proud.

Total cost of my mods in the end? £9 for the basket, £20 (I think, maybe only £10ish) for the distributor, and the naked portafilter as an add-on when I got the ROK. Worth every penny and then some.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve had mine for a few months now, and have read a lot of online discussions about it in that time. Seems to be a lot of people who hate it because “it doesn’t work” and everyone else who likes it “even though it’s not as good as a real machine”. Accurate summary?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can sort of see where both perspectives are coming from, especially if people are trying to use it “as recommended”. Certainly did my head in for a while, especially as it seemed clear early on that standard config/recipes just weren’t doing it for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But finally a breakthrough! I’m now consistently getting fantastic full-quality zero-compromise shots out of it, so I thought I should add a comment now (I think) I’ve got something to add.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the changes. Naked portafilter (Rok), ridgeless 51mm La Pavoni basket, and a 51mm distribution tool (OCD-style). Ditched the tamper (more on that shortly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recipe: 19g in (very fine grind, 6 by default on my Breville Smart Grinder Pro), 42-45g out, in 28-35 seconds. Water off the boil, with two blank shots through the stock portafilter first to warm it up, then swap in the naked. Fill to 3/4cm below the very top, lift the arms, count to ten, then press firmly but steadily until the target weight is reached (noting the time is in range too). Espresso cup is on a stand on the scales so it sits just below the portafilter with enough clearance to view the shot. No tamp, as the distributor is set to an equivalent depth that after a few spins each way it’s fully seated in the basket with equivalent compaction of the puck, but with perfect consistency (I do give a few vertical taps and then a swirl first to settle the loose grinds). Oh, and yeah, use an Aeropress funnel to load the portafilter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crema is consistently rich, espresso itself is consistently smooth and balanced, and the tasting notes come through nice and clear. I’ve paid good money in good specialty cafes and received good espressos that were not quite where the Rok can go now I’ve got it dialled in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be very clear, it took a LOT of experimenting, far more than most people probably have the patience for. But it absolutely paid off. Quality beans are worth it, and freshness is essential. Shot time is a pretty good indicator for grind adjustments too - one experiment used beans from a different roaster, but roasted same day, that were a little lighter, and sure enough the shot time dropped just a touch, as you’d expect, for the lighter roast.&lt;/p&gt;

PS: I sent an email to madebyknock about this issue a few weeks ago, but never got a reply... Probably never buying this brand again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now I&amp;#39;ve only used my Feldgrind 2 hand grinder a couple of times. No problems at first. Made some great coffee with it on my V60. But suddenly the grind consistency is really bad, grinding takes much longer and it results in a lot of fines and a very muddy coffee bed after brewing. I also noticed that there are always some coffee beans particles stuck between the burrs after grinding (Is this normal for a hand grinder?). &lt;/p&gt;

New to this sub, but wanted some advice. I play in an indie rock band, and spend a lot of time on tour. I've tried a few different methods for making coffee on the road, with varying degrees of success. I was wondering if anyone had ideas as to portable coffee making methods. 

&amp;#x200B;

I usually do pourovers at home. I have a baratza burr grinder, gooseneck electric kettle, and V60 + chemex depending on the amount i need to make. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I've tried so far on the road:

\- I spent a long time w/ an aeropress, but it turns out to not be quite as compact as I thought it would (probably still my favorite solution so far, though).

\- I recently got this thing called the pouragami from Miir, but it seems maybe more geared towards campers and less towards specialty coffee people. I've made a few cups with it so far, and the filter tore once, and another time i poured too much water in and it spilled everywhere (the walls of the ""cone"" are quite low compared to any other pour over method I've tried)

&amp;#x200B;

That's what I have for an upcoming tour, but I'm also considering trying to order one of [these](https://paktbags.com/) future tours. It seems nice, and I like the all-in-1 aspect of it. I'd still be missing a grinder, and hand-crank grinders tend to take too long for me. I usually just grind a whole bag before a tour (I know this isn't ideal) and just accept that it won't be quite as good as if I ground it fresh. 

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr**: need portable coffee brewing method, ideally w kettle, brewing method, grinder, and mug all as compactly packable as possible","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi! New to this sub, but wanted some advice. I play in an indie rock band, and spend a lot of time on tour. I&amp;#39;ve tried a few different methods for making coffee on the road, with varying degrees of success. I was wondering if anyone had ideas as to portable coffee making methods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually do pourovers at home. I have a baratza burr grinder, gooseneck electric kettle, and V60 + chemex depending on the amount i need to make. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve tried so far on the road:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I spent a long time w/ an aeropress, but it turns out to not be quite as compact as I thought it would (probably still my favorite solution so far, though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I recently got this thing called the pouragami from Miir, but it seems maybe more geared towards campers and less towards specialty coffee people. I&amp;#39;ve made a few cups with it so far, and the filter tore once, and another time i poured too much water in and it spilled everywhere (the walls of the &amp;quot;cone&amp;quot; are quite low compared to any other pour over method I&amp;#39;ve tried)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what I have for an upcoming tour, but I&amp;#39;m also considering trying to order one of &lt;a href=""https://paktbags.com/""&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; future tours.

The Grind size?  Peets Major Dickasons Dark Roast

Recently tried brewing coffee via French Press with Peets Major Dickasons Dark Roast. Tried yesterday and this morning and the first time I didn’t taste anything. The second time, this morning, all I tasted was “strong”. 

Im trying to figure out what I did wrong. I kinda figure the first time I didn’t let the coffee brew enough. 

The second time I used filtered cold water and the grind was coarse. Used a supermarket grinder. I let the water boil, then waited 30 seconds before pouring. Stirred gently and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Removed some slurry but noticed that it was not until the 10 minute mark where the sediments started to fall to the bottom. I wasn’t sure if something was off or not so I waited another 2-3 minutes, stirred gently, and then lowered the filter to just under the surface and poured. This time the coffee was strong and a little bitter, but I did not taste any of the flavors that were supposed to be associated with this bag of coffee. Any suggestions?  Could it be the French Press???  I got mine in HomeGoods, but I cant imagine making it that much of a difference...  or could I just have had a bad bag of coffee?

-	I’ve used the coffee compass, when it was bitter, I’ve tried to extract less, and when it was too sour, I’ve tried to extract more. The problem is, it was almost always both. I can’t seem to hit the sweet spot between over and underextraction.

I know this is probably beating a dead horse to death on here...But I just re-learned the importance of quality brewing H20 and thought I'd share. 

Home brewer here for about 4 yrs. A commandant and V60 are my weapons of choice. 

Started using the [Third Wave Water (TWW)](https://thirdwavewater.com) packets about two years ago or so. This was after using tap (in Tennessee) for about a year, then trying various bottled water brands and then experimenting with the Barista Hustle DIY water. Ultimately I found it easier to simply throw in a packet of TWW to a gallon of distilled. 

I ran out of TWW several months ago about the time I moved to Denver CO. Lots of awesome roasters here in Denver. Was excited to try beans from Huckleberry, Sweet Bloom, and others. There is seemingly a third wave roaster on every corner here. 

Tried lots of different light roasts from various shops here, and just haven't been overly impressed with the brews I was making at home. Because I just hadn't gotten around to ordering my TWW again, I was using the tap, and  various bottled waters from a local supermarket. I even tried diluting various bottled brands with distilled. Tap with distilled. No luck. 

Finally got around to ordering TWW again. 

This morning, I brewed an Ethiopian from [Corvus](https://www.corvuscoffee.com) that I've had for a couple weeks (and been using either tap water or bottled ""spring"" water). This morning I used TWW. FINALLY was tasting those berry notes promised on the bag. Was it a DRAMATIC difference? No. Was it noticeable? Absolutely. Subtleties in the brew were present that weren't present before. 

Bottom line: If you are willing to spend money on quality beans, an expensive burr grinder, and spend time perfecting your pour technique, its very possible you STILL are not soaking the potential out of those beans until you brew with coffee-specific H20. 

OK, I haven't brewed with tap from EVERY city. Maybe some tap renders an ideal cup. But you don't know that until you try something else. As has been mentioned on here before, your perception of how the tap water tastes does not correlate to being a quality coffe-specific brewing water. 

In my experience, bottled water also really does NOT cut it when compared with DIY water or TWW. Using the TWW packets amounts to just a few cents more for each brewed cup. Totally worth it in my opinion. For me, anyway, I'm not in this to necessarily be as fiscally responsible as possible. Its my hobby after all. I've already plunged in with a $250 hand grinder.

I made a point to explore the coffee culture with a particular focus on the burgeoning specialty coffee industry. Much has already been written about the development of specialty coffee in Vietnam, but a lot has happened in just the past few years that made my visit particularly interesting.

Vietnam has a significant place in coffee history. It is the world's second-largest producer, but about 97% of the output is Robusta and sold to companies like Nestle ([source](https://sprudge.com/interview-will-frith-43112.html), [source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-07/world-craving-for-vietnam-s-robusta-coffee-has-exports-surging)). Vietnamese people also consume a tremendous volume of coffee ([source](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/vietnam-s-caffeine-thirst-puts-it-in-world-s-top-growing-coffee-markets-3549858.html)), which is obvious to anyone who has visited and seen the countless coffee shops that dot the streets. These shops are mainly community-oriented places with long hours that serve Robusta prepared in traditional ways. Specialty Arabica coffee--characterized by its broad flavor profiles, newfangled brewing techniques, and higher costs--remains largely a novelty.

The purpose of this post is not to judge or criticize the existing coffee industry in Vietnam, but to provide some insight to those with similar tastes and interests. Below are my impressions of six specialty coffee shops that I visited.

**Hanoi**

* *Ella Specialty Cafe Roaster*: This cafe, located about 1km from where I stayed in Quang An, was my introduction to specialty coffee in Vietnam. The chalkboard sign out front proudly depicts a Diedrich roaster and various specialty brewing equipment. Inside the space is like a high-end version of IKEA. Notably, it appears to be entirely women-owned. I had a V60 of a single-origin from Risaralda, Colombia, which was brewed extremely carefully and had a pleasantly orangey profile, but was slightly baked. The place features awesome views of West Lake and the baristas were outgoing and clearly excited about what they were doing, although they noted to me that the place (less than a year old) had so far mainly appealed to foreigners.
* *Kafeville*: This is an oasis on an otherwise not terribly appealing street in Ba Dinh. I stopped in during an accidentally long walk on a scorching-hot day and, in an out-of-character moment, ordered the cold brew. It was very good: single-origin Colombian served in a tiny flip-top bottle, and the roast level imparted the round chocolate notes that I enjoy in cold brew. They also roast their own beans on a small machine that I didn't recognize, located right in the front of the shop. Like every other specialty shop I tried in Hanoi, they offer Robusta along with Arabica and prepare it as espresso with or without sweetened condensed milk. My SO got it with milk (""nua"" or ""white"") and it was pretty striking: earthy, woody, grassy flavors really stood out. A nice ""study"" in Robusta.
* *Blackbird*: This cafe served the best coffee I had in Hanoi. It's located on a busy street in the Old Quarter and was absolutely packed when we arrived in the late morning. The space is structured like a large cube, and there's a balcony that provides additional seating and an excellent view of the space. A key feature is that they only serve Vietnamese coffee--both Robusta and Arabica. I had a V60 of a Catimor grown on Langbiang Mountain in Dalat at 1650masl. This coffee was well-developed but there was hardly any hint of roast, which let the coffee speak for itself. It was delicious: delicate, citrusy, with good complexity and sweetness. I enjoyed it so much I then got an espresso--also Catimor, roasted medium, and pulled on a Victoria Arduino Black Eagle, it was velvety in texture although not particularly interesting. The manager was friendly and knowledgable, and he explained that, while challenging, high-quality Arabica production in Vietnam is possible because there is sufficient elevation in certain areas like Dalat. My SO again got a Robusta (natural, grown in Gia Lai, 450masl), white, and it was also the best I had in Hanoi: super rich and chocolaty but balanced and not too muddy in flavor.
* *Atelier Coffee Roaster*: Sleek, low-key spot in Ba Dinh. The counters are strewn with specialty coffee gear, including a wide array of pour-over devices. A bit unfortunately, my relatively expensive pour-over of a washed coffee from Kiambu, Kenya, was prepared using a Wilfa Svart rather than the EK 43 sitting a few feet away. The coffee, roasted by Just Bean Roastery (although Atelier roasts their own coffee too), was still good: bright, fruity, and obviously Kenyan, but a bit thin and under-extracted due to the very coarse grind. Once again, the brewer took great care weighing, pouring, timing, and even tasting a small sample before serving it to me. My SO's Robusta with milk was intense and rich with lots of earthiness. The cafe was extremely calm and practically empty at 9:30AM, when the owners were putzing around, organizing chairs and lighting incense, but started to fill up later in the morning. This place also happens to be a couple hundred meters from Anh Hoa Bakery, which is one of the best French-style bakeries in Hanoi.

**Ho Chi Minh City**

* *The Workshop*: This is the oldest and most famous specialty shop in HCMC. It's on the third floor of an old walk-up building in District 1 that features massive windows and high, vaulted ceilings. This was also the busiest and most self-assured place I went. They roast all their own coffee (both imported and domestic) and utilize pretty much every brewing device you can think of. My SO and I split a ""large"" pour-over of a washed Caturra/Catuai blend from Tarrazu, Costa Rica, that was brewed in an all-copper V60 setup. Lots of ripe citrus intermingled with assertive dark chocolate that was brought out by the slight roastiness of it. It was quite enjoyable, though at 135K VND it was disappointingly tiny--no more than 10 or 11oz total. The whole place feels much more Westernized than anywhere else I went; the tables are filled with fashionably dressed young people on their phones and laptops, and the baristas are not particularly interested in chatting.
* *Shin Coffee*: Also in District 1 and extremely close to Workshop, this shop is smaller and features a more eclectic, Pier 1 vibe. Cool and calm with two levels of seating and wall-to-wall shelves full of coffee paraphernalia, including a Q Robusta Grader certificate. They roast all their own coffee on two tiny sample roasters and one slightly larger one, and they offer various blends as well as seasonal single-origins. I got a V60 of the ""Shin blend,"" which is an all-Arabica combination of coffees from Vietnam, Africa, and Central America. It had lots of nuttiness with a bit of citrus and good complexity and sweetness despite the elevated roast, and it was served in a bone China cup and saucer with gold-leaf decals. My SO got the super-decadent egg coffee (more like a coffee mousse).

Other places that baristas recommended that I did not visit include Acid 8 (Hanoi), Tranquil Books &amp; Coffee (Hanoi), Cotero (Hanoi), The Berry Field (Hanoi), Red Door (HCMC), Bosgaurus Coffee (HCMC), La Viet (HCMC), and Saigon Coffee Roastery (HCMC). Several of these places are just a few months old.

Prices generally ranged from 55,000-80,000 VND for a 8-10oz pour-over (so about 2.40-3.50 USD). For reference, that's about 2-4x as expensive as traditional Vietnamese coffee. Yes, portions in Vietnam are rather small compared to the US.

Overall, I was most impressed with the very high level of care and attention proprietors are putting into new specialty cafes and roasteries in Vietnam. Every staff member I spoke to was clearly passionate about what they were doing, in addition to being warm and polite. This contrasted a bit with my experiences in certain specialty cafes here in the US. Every pour-over I ordered was prepared extremely carefully with (mostly) proper equipment, although techniques, and results, varied considerably.

In terms of the coffee itself, I would say there is significant room for growth. Many of the roasters are sourcing high-quality green coffee but, at least to my palate, struggling a bit with roasting. Of course what I view as flaws may be intentional. Moreover, lots of other coffee cultures around the world gravitate toward darker roasts. But there can be lots of subtlety and artistry in darker roasts too, and more than a few times the coffee I had was noticeably ashy. (This week I've been drinking Irving Farm's house blend, which is squarely medium and absolutely phenomenal. With so much depth, complexity, and sweetness at a significantly elevated roast level, it's basically a case study in how to develop darker roasts.)

It is also hard not to notice that, at this stage, a significant fraction--perhaps a majority--of the customers at the specialty shops are foreigners. This isn't very surprising; the specialty stuff is much more expensive and contrasts starkly with what millions of Vietnamese people have been drinking all their lives. But as in other countries, there's a core of baristas and roasters dedicated to changing the way others view and experience coffee. There is clearly great potential in Vietnam for producing, roasting, and serving top-quality specialty coffee, and I'm excited to see what happens next.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently got back from a two-week stay in Vietnam, where I split time between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.

Unfortunately, I had forgotten about it because I'm a moron, and so it sat there, aging. So I decided to pull a shot of it on my BBE.

But those of you who have the machine know that the grinder is very intolerant of aged beans. So with the grinder set to the finest setting possible, I ground up 18g of coffee, loaded it up, and began the manual shot.

It barely registered above the pre-infusion pressure on the built-in gauge. I did 10 seconds of pre-infusion, 22 seconds after for a total time of 32 seconds. The flow was high and the output was much more liquid than normal. I didn't weigh the output, but the result shocked me.

It was one of the best shots I've had in my life. Bright and sweet, loads of strawberry notes.

Beautiful journey.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This morning I came across a mini-bag of the Esmeralda Geisha I roasted well over a month ago-- about 100g of the &amp;quot;leftovers&amp;quot; that come as a perk of the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I had forgotten about it because I&amp;#39;m a moron, and so it sat there, aging. So I decided to pull a shot of it on my BBE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But those of you who have the machine know that the grinder is very intolerant of aged beans. So with the grinder set to the finest setting possible, I ground up 18g of coffee, loaded it up, and began the manual shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It barely registered above the pre-infusion pressure on the built-in gauge. I did 10 seconds of pre-infusion, 22 seconds after for a total time of 32 seconds. The flow was high and the output was much more liquid than normal. I didn&amp;#39;t weigh the output, but the result shocked me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was one of the best shots I&amp;#39;ve had in my life. Bright and sweet, loads of strawberry notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I know less about coffee every day I spend learning about it. Beautiful journey.&lt;/p&gt;

So I'm looking into getting a starter machine.

It's relatively new so I haven't been able to find a lot of discussions about it on this sub. I know the downside is the pf size and attached grinder, but it heats up quick and seems pretty straight forward. 

However, after talking to my friend who is really into coffee, he suggested Lelit Anna or Rancilio Silvia. Lelit and Rancilio don't come with the grinder, obviously. What I have right now is the Baratza Virtuoso. It works well for Chemex but I heard it's not ideal for espresso. I don't really want to upgrade my grinder right now since I just got the grinder less than 2 years ago. I feel like these two machines are being talked about a lot in this sub. Any user experience would be greatly appreciated! Do they take a long time warm up the machines in the morning? Are they easy to use? Are they well built? 

I do want to save up more to invest in nicer equipment in the future and spend more time perfecting my skills, but for now I just want to have the option to have a decent cup of coffee in the morning without spending too much time doing it.

So I’ve had a look at the Porlex grinder, it’s reviewed well and costs £50. Some have stated that grinding takes an age with this grinder so that’s a bit of a deal breaker. 

So I’m now prepared to pull a few extra notes out of my wallet or even unleash the dreaded credit card and open up some new grinder avenues. 

My Google research has led me to a few new possibilities:

- Timemore Chestnut (capacity 30g)
- Timemore Slim (capacity 20g)
- Aergrind 
- Aerspeed (seen it on MBK website, know very little about it)
- Izpresso grinders (know very little about them)

These are my first impressions. As a side note, any temperature readings I provide here should be taken with a grain of salt, as I only have a cheap instant read thermometer on hand.

**Setup:**

Setting the machine up took about 30 minutes. The process involves washing all of the brewing parts: carafe + lid, filter basket, cone filter insert and the showerhead. After you've dried them, you reassemble the brewer and fill the water tank up to max, then use the included water test strip to rate your hardness on a scale from 1 to 5. After that you run a cycle with no coffee to flush the pump and let everything dry out.

**Brewing:**

I made my first cups this morning with an Ethiopian roast from a local shop, using the ""Gold"" setting on the machine, which is the automatic setting for producing an SCA-certified cup of coffee. For my first round of experimenting, I basically went with their recommended defaults. I ground my beans at 18 on an Encore, then made a 10 oz cup with 2 scoops of grinds using the included scoop. (The chart in the manual states that this is about 16.5 grams of coffee.) At volumes of 20 oz of water or less, the brewer allows you to brew directly into a cup or travel mug--I elected to use a bog-standard ceramic mug. I would rate the resulting coffee as a fairly average pour over cup; I tasted the normal fruity notes I expected, and although it was a little under extracted I suspect this is more a problem with my grind size. The coffee overall was significantly cooler than a comparable pour-over cup-- about 130 degrees Fahrenheit. Part of the temperature drop can be attributed to the travel time between the dripper and the mug, as well as the fact that my mug was not pre-warmed.

With this in mind, I brewed a second cup of the same size in the thermal carafe instead. Here, it measured about 145 degrees Fahrenheit. This was the last cup I made, but I did some more testing on brewing temperature in general. Opening up the brew basket mid brew and checking the temperature, I got about 180 degrees Fahrenheit, which I plan to compare to the temperature in my Kalita mid-brew soon, since I don't have a benchmark for water temperature mid-brew in standard pour-over. I also tested brewing temperature for the highly customizable ""My Brew"" setting set to 195 degrees Fahrenheit, and got about 170 degrees.

I can provide some possible explanations for the temperature drop:

* The first is that the machine is not as accurate as Breville claimed. While I'm willing to bet that the margin of error for temperature is a little wider than advertised, enough review sites praised the precision of this machine that I don't believe this to be the case.
* The other is merely distance traveled by the water. The heating mechanism in the brewer is located close to the bottom, while the showerhead is at the top. So, the water is pumped through the full length of the brewer, coming into contact with unheated components at each step and losing energy. Then, after it passes through the grinds, it falls a distance of several inches to the bottom of the cup or carafe, or the surface of the coffee if some has already made it down, losing more energy to the air all the way. With this in mind, I'm willing to bet that the more coffee you brew, the closer the temperature is to the ideal value, as the components become preheated.

**Conclusion**

Overall, I'm satisfied with my initial experience. I'm hoping to tinker some more and experiment with the My Brew setting when I have time, as well as see what I can do to improve temperature precision. As an aside, the thermal carafe for this machine is the best I've seen! It's easy to clean, pours without dripping, and has a brew through lid, putting it miles ahead of the Bonavita carafes.

I live in the UK, and have been having instant coffee every day, with milk and sugar to ease the bitterness away.

Also, I'm a big tea drinker. (Mostly single estate brewed Gongfu style for anyone who cares)

It all started with an offhand comment I saw somewhere about how the difference between teabags and loose leaf good quality single estate tea is similar to the difference between instant and freshly brewed coffee.

I got curious, so started Googling. No joke, I used to think instant coffee was the only coffee. I came across the suggestion to read the World Atlas of Coffee. After reading it I understood... A little bit. With a quick Google, I found 'Pact Coffee' and saw they were selling a v60 pour over brewer and some preground coffee very cheaply. I thought this was great! Preground! Oh how naive I was.

It came the next day, and after a messy confusing brew, I tasted it and thought I found heaven. This was so much better than instant coffee! It was one of the first coffees I could happily enjoy black. I just wanted more. So I went out and bought some Starbucks preground and fell in love with that too.

I was stuck in my beautiful habit of using my tiny tea scale, spilling preground coffee everywhere, and blindly brewing preground coffee every morning and singing its praises. 

In browsing this subreddit for good preground coffee, I saw all the posts about how you shouldn't buy preground coffee. So, I researched grinders, and wasn't exactly extatic about the price.

I found what was touted as -the- entry level hand grinder, then started saving for my Porlex grinder. After a little while, it came. I ordered some light roasted beans from Hasbean, and ground. Wow. It was the most enjoyable cup of coffee I ever had. Preground coffee had never looked so inadequate. This started my downwards spiral into coffee madness.

I spent a while in this subreddit looking for tips and tricks. I got an old French press from a family member and scrubbed it, I got a cheap scale timer, I got a brita filter. I watched a ton of James Hoffman (thank you u/kingseven), improved my coffee technique and now here I am.

I'm drinking the nicest freshly ground coffee I've ever had, and I'm gonna start my very slow save for a Baratza Encore to improve my coffee drinking experience. It'll take a while, but this like tea is a habit I'm okay sinking money into even if it takes months.

I'm at the point where I'm trying not to drink multiple cups a day, and whenever I walk past my coffee drawer I smell the coffee beans and it's just pure joy. 

I'm sure I have a long way to go, I've never even had an espresso, but I want to thank you for how far you've gotten me already.

Background.   My SO gifted me my 10 cup Chemex a few years ago for Christmas.  It was a very tight year for her, but she managed to find a way to get it for me, knowing that I'm a coffee ~~snob~~ *aficionado* (she's not, but she does love my coffee).  She managed to snag a used one with the older glass, so a great find.

Anyway, yesterday I killed it.  No disrespect to the build quality, but when you violently yank the drying mat out from under it, it falls off the counter and breaks, you can't really blame *it*.

So ...  she's likely to get me a replacement for Christmas.

In the meantime, I have an opportunity to try another brew method.

Here's what I have or have had in the past:

* Bonavita 1900TS
* Aeropress

* Unbranded Ceramic Pour-over (purchased from Starbucks)

Just wondering what are people's thoughts on this; lots and lots of posts about it but no one really focused on whether a thermal carafe (specifically the Hario one) will affect the flavour of coffee, as it is brewed into it? I will be pouring it out to drink within 30 min usually. The heat retention is not a HUGE part of it, it's the breakability of the carafe. (granted I had this glass server since 2011 and I've been brewing into it regularly for the last 2-3 years).

The main reason I am considering a non glass one is because I just tried to brew some iced coffee into my old glass server and it shattered, due to a combination of the ice hitting it and the heat shock. Just for overall durability and long term investment... and being able to brew iced coffee haha, but not wanting to sacrifice flavour. How many people can notice the difference for carafes, NOT having it in a travel tumbler/mug and drinking it hours later.

I started with a Baratza Encore, and it has been a fantastic grinder. However, I tend to be a bit OCD, so I upgraded to a Baratza Forte BG. It came in yesterday, and this morning was the first time I got to use it. 

For the past week I have been making a phenomenal locally roasted single origin natural process Ethiopian just using just the factory recommended grind setting of ""14"" on my Encore and approximately the Rau method with my V60. The cup had perfect acidity without being sour, watery, or bitter. It really tasted like something entirely different than any coffee I had ever had. Today, I tried twice with two different factory recommended settings on my new grinder and wasn't able to replicate it. Something was just a bit ""off"" with the flavor, and I'm sure it is the grind difference is causing the extraction to change (I didn't change water temp or brew method.) 

Looking for advice on how to most quickly get back to being able to make the coffee I love. I have the Encore listed for sale but haven't sold it yet, so the best idea I had so far was to grab an inexpensive coffee (Dunkin Donuts Original was on sale for $5.99/12oz so I bought that, figuring I can still make a reasonable cold brew with the leftover,) grind a ""control batch"" with my Encore, and try to replicate the grind size as close as possible before going back to my good coffee. Tomorrow morning I will attempt another run at making the perfect cup, but if it tastes ""off"" I'll brew a control batch with my Encore to make sure it isn't my palette that is off. 

Any other ideas on what I can do? If I had more experience I'm sure I could adjust on the fly, but really I'm still not positive where this morning's batches went wrong. I've consulted the coffee compass but am still unsure.

Maybe I just want to describe something and see if there is agreement out there or if I'm maybe doing something wrong.

I'm 2 or 3 months into my non-drip coffee journey. I've mostly been using my AeroPress for that time. And just bought (Target brand) Chemex knock off several days ago. I believe I'm using a reasonable technique (gooseneck, washing filters, bloom, grind size and pouring that brews in about 3:30 minutes...16.6:1 ratio).

AP technique is basically 13:1 ratio (sounds high, but all the recipes seem to be around 15g coffee to about 200g of water), pour water in over about 20-30 seconds. Stir a few times. Sit for 1 minute. Stir another once or twice, and then plunge over about 30 seconds. Sometimes I'll add another 30 grams of water to the coffee because it is a bit intense. 

In short: a pour over of my preferred coffee is less enjoyable than the AeroPress equivalent. The AP brew has more body by far. I know it is a finer grind which would likely result in some of those fines making it into the brew and adding to the mouthfeel.

I've heard so much about pour over that I guess I expected more from it. I'll continue to use it and try it with different coffees. But so far AP is easier with better results. 

So I guess I don't really have a question here other than this: does anything stand out as problematic?

ps - Admittedly, my palate isn't very good. So that may be at play here too. Meaning, subtleties of the pour over may be lost on me.

1) Do I stretch my budget for a Dual Boiler versus a Heat Exchanger? 

2) If  going for a HX, is the PID worth the while? 

3) Are Lelit's products as reliable and durable as Rocket's or Linea's? 

4) How would you re-order the machines listed below? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Rationale (in order of consideration) /** 

**Rocket Appartamento:** 

\+ Reliable and durable

\+ Decent size 

\+ Price 

\- Not a fan of the design 

\- No PID 

&amp;#x200B;

**Lelit Mara:** 

\+ Beautiful wood finishing 

\+ Small size 

\- Worried it is not up to the standard of Rocket or Linea 

\- Less control on boiler temp 

&amp;#x200B;

**Lelit Bianca:** 

\+ Beautiful wood finishing 

\+ Pressure control and PID 

\- Worried it is not up to the standard of Rocket or Linea 

\- On the bigger and more expensive end 

&amp;#x200B;

**Rocket R58:** 

\+ Dual boiler 

\+ Reliable and durable 

\- Not a fan of the design 

\- On the bigger and more expensive end 

&amp;#x200B;

**Linea Mini:** 

\+ Beautiful build quality

\+ Dual boiler 

\+ Temperature control 

\+ Reliable and durable

\- No pressure control 

\- Over budget

I have been on this journey to create consistently perfect double shots and I feel like I'm getting closer, but at the same time I'm having trouble and feel like I'm still miles off.

I recently purchased a wooden manual grinder and found that it can get an extremely fine grind that's like a smooth velvety powder. My last grinder made it a bit too course and I couldn't adjust it.

My problem is that despite that grind resulting in the smoothest, most divine espresso I've ever tasted, I can't seem to manage to pour the right amount. I've been experimenting with amounts, pour time, and grind, and got the best results so far with 14g of coffee, poured for 30-35 seconds, but I can't seem to get more than 25ml out of that.

I've tried adjusting my grinder to be less fine, but whatever I do seems to either make no difference to the fineness, or it goes too far the other way and the grind is too course, even if I adjust it clockwise by tiny degrees, it just seems to be one extreme or the other...like trying to get the right temperature in the shower, it's either too hot or too cold.
I've also tried tamping it lighter, but that only seemed to make a slightly weaker taste while not really increasing the amount of liquid flowing through.

Does anyone have any ideas for how to get that perfect grind? Or is there another factor I should alter? Perhaps there are variables that I'm not taking into account?

I'm hoping that the fineness isn't the issue because I got the best tasting coffee with the finest grind, so I'd love to be able to use that setting but somehow get 60ml of that same strength.

I have been trying to improve my espresso shots with the Breville XL. Here are are some things that I have noticed and I'm doing for each shot. 

&amp;#x200B;

So first I measure 18 grams then I grind to whichever level appropriate for the beans. Then I grind a bit then tamp it in lightly. If I don't do this, it gets hard to tamp and the beans overflow. Once beans fully ground I give it a good tamp and put the portaiflter in it's place. Set the timer to 0. Click on the timer and the double espresso button. 

Once I have about 36 grams of espresso, I stop the machine. I noticed that if I don't it would just keep going and produce maybe 70 grams of watered espresso. Is anyone dealing with that? 

&amp;#x200B;

But with me intervening and stopping, I get about 37 grams of espresso in around 30 seconds. Tastes good, 

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm wondering about the most is why the default setting produces a lot of liquid? 

&amp;#x200B;

Some notes: 

\- Tamp lightly multiple times otherwise the grounds overflows. 

\- Default settings for a double shot are way off, unless there is something I'm missing. 

\- It's absolutely important to measure beans going in and liquid coming out and not just time.

I currently have a french press and a V60 and a terrible 10$ grinder which does not do the job very well.  
I am planning on buying a better grinder (going down the rabbit hole) and was looking at the Baratza Encore as none of the other brands from the wiki for mid range are available in India. I am confused if the encore is good for beginners like me as some people have said that its not very consistent and will produce fines in the grind.

I do not plan on making espressos so I am happy with the slightly coarse grind. I do not care about portability as I will not travel with it. My only concern is the grind quality to get a better cup of coffee. I only plan on using it for medium to coarse grinds.

I could possibly stretch my budget and get the Virtuoso or maybe even the Virtuoso+ or the Sette (only if the difference in quality is huge) but not if it will not make a ton of difference, Can someone give out some good advice here?

I also know that I could get the Virtuoso burr set and make the Encore give out the same quality but Baratza does not ship to India and I am having a hard time finding anyone ship any of those parts to India.

Should I go for the Encore or splurge a bit and go for the Virtuoso+ or Sette or is there some better option available for me over here?

What is the difference between the Virtuoso and the Virtuoso+

Here is how much each grinder costs

Encore - 167 USD

Virtuoso - 245 USD

Virtuoso+ - 280 USD

Sette - 280 USD

Thanks for helping out. :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello good people. I currently have a french press and a V60 and a terrible 10$ grinder which does not do the job very well.&lt;br/&gt;
I am planning on buying a better grinder (going down the rabbit hole) and was looking at the Baratza Encore as none of the other brands from the wiki for mid range are available in India. I am confused if the encore is good for beginners like me as some people have said that its not very consistent and will produce fines in the grind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not plan on making espressos so I am happy with the slightly coarse grind. I do not care about portability as I will not travel with it. My only concern is the grind quality to get a better cup of coffee. I only plan on using it for medium to coarse grinds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could possibly stretch my budget and get the Virtuoso or maybe even the Virtuoso+ or the Sette (only if the difference in quality is huge) but not if it will not make a ton of difference, Can someone give out some good advice here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also know that I could get the Virtuoso burr set and make the Encore give out the same quality but Baratza does not ship to India and I am having a hard time finding anyone ship any of those parts to India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I go for the Encore or splurge a bit and go for the Virtuoso+ or Sette or is there some better option available for me over here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the difference between the Virtuoso and the Virtuoso+&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how much each grinder costs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encore - 167 USD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtuoso - 245 USD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtuoso+ - 280 USD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sette - 280 USD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for helping out. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It broke after two times :(  possibily because I like to grind it finely -- for my Moka pot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TBH I don&amp;#39;t need a manual one; likely an electric one is better for me. But if it helps save significant amount of money I&amp;#39;m happy to buy a plain manual grinder, as long as it will last 2-3 years (1-2 usages per week).&lt;/p&gt;

I got moka pot as a gift recently and it already does not look good after using it for less then two weeks (it drives me insane).

Coffee made from that pot taste great though :)

Making coffee:

I pour water up to the safety tip, add coffee grinds over the mark in gasket, assemble and put it on top
of induction stove top to boil water and wait till it pour all water out (till top reservoir is full and no water left) and then take the pot off the stove.

Cleaning:
Disassemble and rinse with warm water. Dry up with towel or tissues and leave it disassembled to dry up where i could not reach otherwise.

I noticed that after first two uses - bottom part instead of shiny became tinted in copper-like color and now has some weird looking spots.

Insides of water reservoir became rough and have some darker spots/marks.

Could bottom part of water reservoir could be cleaned/made look good/anew again? Soapy water does not help.

Could inside part be cleaned? Maybe i need to use vinegar / water mix with empty gasket and make it run through pot once to get it clean inside ?

**The problem:** the coffee doesn't taste bad, but it tastes rather rough. Hard to describe, but it doesnt seem very balanced, but it's also not extreme, but on the same time extreme. The same cup tastes both over extracted and under extracted. This became more apparent after visiting Glitch in Tokyo a few times last week. Their V60 tasted very balanced on any bean - my favorite cup (a natural Nicaraguan) I bought but I'm not able to recreate the same smoothness. 


Over the last months I tried:


**Different brewing methods:** Tetsu Kasuyas recipe worked out okayish for me, Scott Raos wasn't drinkable at all because the filter clogged, now I settled with James Hoffmanns method as it's the only one that helps me achieve less than 4 minute with a 500ml brew.


**Different filters:** I usually used the bleached, tabbed ones from the second factory in Japan, but now I have the untabbed ones and still get the same result


**Different water:** I used to use filtered (Brita) water, now I changed to Volvic brand water as it is very close to third wave water and available in 8L bottles because I want to keep the plastic waste as little as possible


**Different beans:** Now with beans from The Barn I get decent result, but other ones I almost always get very long brew time, even highly critically acclaimed roasters like Machhörndl.


**Different grind sizes:** from 2:0 to 3:6 on the aergrind I tried everything, for now I settled on 2:11


Rest is mostly standard equipment. Goose neck kettle, scale, Aergrind, ceramic v60.


Since I changed almost anything already, I kinda suspect the grinder as the culprit, especially in regards to clogging with certain brew methods/beans. But then on the other hand the Chemex tastes a lot more balanced with the same grinder (a slightly more coarse grind).


Now I bought a Kalita Tsubame 155, and even though I totally messed up the first brew (2:15 end time..) it already tastes a lot more balanced than my V60 brews. As far as I understand Chemex and Kalita (especially the Tsubame) are a lot more forgiving regarding grind size, but still, could the grinder be the problem? If so, how come? I dont expect the grind quality of a MK EK43, but a 150€ Aergrind should be able to produce a decent v60 cup, shouldn't it?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m looking into this for months now, slowly changing all parameters. &lt;/p&gt;

Just got an AeroPress and have a question about extraction. I watched James Hoffman’s video about how much coffee you should use and how to adjust the ratio when you like the flavor but adjust the extraction to get to your desired flavor. Also have been using the compass as reference. 

When extracting, particularly looking to extract less, how do you know whether or not you should make your grinds coarser or if you should just shorten your brew time? I thought the coarser your grind is, the longer you’d want to extract to allow the water to penetrate the thicker grind.

I’m using a Costa Rican Honey Process medium/light roast from Happy Mug and Tim Wendelboe’s AeroPress method which is:

*standard method (not inverted)*

*14g coffee/ 200g water (medium/fine grind)*

*205F water*

*1 minute brew*

*3 stirs at start and at finish* 

I started with a finer grind and noticed my coffee was pretty overwhelming so I’m figuring I need to extract less because there wasn’t any flavor. I made the grinds coarser and was able to get more of the honey taste in the brew (particularly the scent and aftertaste), but think that there’s a way for me to get a more refined flavor. Would've kept experimenting but I probably would've got heart palpitations. For reference I'm using a Lido E and was at  1+2 for my tastiest cup.

Unsure if should keep making grind seize coarser and keep the brew time the same or make the grind even more coarser and increase the brew time to compensate for the above-proportion increase in grind size. Hope this makes sense!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

I watched James Hoffman’s video about how much coffee you should use and how to adjust the ratio when you like the flavor but adjust the extraction to get to your desired flavor. Also have been using the compass as reference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When extracting, particularly looking to extract less, how do you know whether or not you should make your grinds coarser or if you should just shorten your brew time? I thought the coarser your grind is, the longer you’d want to extract to allow the water to penetrate the thicker grind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m using a Costa Rican Honey Process medium/light roast from Happy Mug and Tim Wendelboe’s AeroPress method which is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;standard method (not inverted)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;14g coffee/ 200g water (medium/fine grind)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;205F water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 minute brew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3 stirs at start and at finish&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with a finer grind and noticed my coffee was pretty overwhelming so I’m figuring I need to extract less because there wasn’t any flavor. I made the grinds coarser and was able to get more of the honey taste in the brew (particularly the scent and aftertaste), but think that there’s a way for me to get a more refined flavor. Would&amp;#39;ve kept experimenting but I probably would&amp;#39;ve got heart palpitations. For reference I&amp;#39;m using a Lido E and was at  1+2 for my tastiest cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsure if should keep making grind seize coarser and keep the brew time the same or make the grind even more coarser and increase the brew time to compensate for the above-proportion increase in grind size. Hope this makes sense!&lt;/p&gt;

Since I love cold coffee, I thought I'd give Hoffman's iced pour over a try. Last night I brewed my pour over before bed, put it in a glass decanter and let it sit in the fridge overnight so I could wake up for work this morning and just pour it over ice. I was amazed at how smooth and tasty it was. Low acidity, bright flavors and just overall very enjoyable. I think it's safe to say I like this better than cold brew and it goes to show that if you put in the effort you can get coffee shop quality coffee at home. 

That's all I wanted to share, I'm just super excited that the coffee turned out great! 

For anyone interested, here's the instructions I used from Hoffman with a little twist from another YouTube video I watched.

Coffee- A Natural Brazilian Coffee from a local roaster

Water- Filtered with a Brita Filter

Pour Over Device- GSI Java Drip (going to be upgrading to the V60 soon)

32g of medium ground coffee

115g of ice

335g of water

Bloomed the coffee for 45 seconds with 60g of water, then slowly poured the water to have a brew time of 3:30 seconds.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a lot of people I know want to hear me brag about coffee or even try to talk about it, so I thought I&amp;#39;d share here!

Last night I brewed my pour over before bed, put it in a glass decanter and let it sit in the fridge overnight so I could wake up for work this morning and just pour it over ice. I was amazed at how smooth and tasty it was. Low acidity, bright flavors and just overall very enjoyable. I think it&amp;#39;s safe to say I like this better than cold brew and it goes to show that if you put in the effort you can get coffee shop quality coffee at home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all I wanted to share, I&amp;#39;m just super excited that the coffee turned out great! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested, here&amp;#39;s the instructions I used from Hoffman with a little twist from another YouTube video I watched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee- A Natural Brazilian Coffee from a local roaster&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water- Filtered with a Brita Filter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pour Over Device- GSI Java Drip (going to be upgrading to the V60 soon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;32g of medium ground coffee&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;115g of ice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;335g of water&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloomed the coffee for 45 seconds with 60g of water, then slowly poured the water to have a brew time of 3:30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

This made really really good coffee, but only a couple oz. I did a little reading and adjusted the grind, going for a slightly coarser grind. All else remaining equal, this resulted in bitter coffee spurting out all over my stove, unlike the nice (if short) flow I had been getting before. Any idea what I’m doing wrong here? Other variable to adjust? Thank you kindly&lt;/p&gt;

First some background (I promise this will be important). About 18 months ago, I decided to try fancy coffee, went out and got an Aeropress and [Bialetti's hand grinder](https://www.bialetti.com/coffee/accessories/coffee-grinder-c-1_10_79.html) (which cost me $25 at the time as I recall, though it seems to have risen in price since then). Last week I saw the post about IKEA and, reading the comments, discovered that they were also offering a stainless steel hand grinder. As promised, I headed to my local IKEA to get one for $29.99 MSRP (just under 33 bucks total) and see if it would be an upgrade for the same price.

It's essentially exactly the same internally as the Bialetti. The adjustment knob is slightly chunkier, but the burr and casing is indistinguishable aside from some small color differences. And there's one big problem with this grinder (as far as I can tell, I am open to correction).

https://i.redd.it/gd0bb0oh2fn31.jpg

The fact that the burr is held in place by that spring means that it's quite difficult to get a consistent adjustment, and there's enough wiggle room for the burr to have a bigger gap on one side than the other. My experience with the Bialetti has been that it works quite well for Aeropress, Moka, or French press, but isn't precise enough to conjure a satisfying V60. Additionally, the Bialetti is much more convenient to get beans into, since it has a tapered hopper, the bottom is easier to get off when grinding is done, it's clear and lets you see how much is left to grind, and the handle is more pleasant. Since the internals of both grinders are plastic, the stainless steel is purely aesthetic, so assuming you can still find the plastic Bialetti for a little cheaper the Metallisk simply doesn't make a lot of sense to me (If I'm misremembering the price, this is a decent entry-level grinder I think). Which makes me a little sad, since it has the fattest IKEA instruction manual I have yet seen.

* Bean-to-cup is OK, but I have a grinder that I'm happy with, so if I could save cost/improve quality by adding my own grounds, that would be better.
* Reliability is important. I don't want it breaking down after 1-2 years. For that reason, machines with baskets/gaskets are not preferred

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/dgkm1o/nitro_coffee_project/#

&gt;Hi guys,
&gt;
&gt;First time posting here. I have a small project I'm working on at work. I'm trying to make some revisions on our cold brew portable jockey box so that it can be used as a near standalone &gt;portable nitro kegerator. I'm I am trying to build from scratch something similar to the Kegoutlet's Nitro Infuser/Micromatic Mininim nitrogen infusion module. I have taken apart both and &gt;examined the components and am curious about one part in particular which might be a hitch in the planning phase.
&gt;
&gt;Inside there is a T union for when the cold brew and the nitrogen blend. I'm curious if a vacuum ejector is what that part is as its pretty bulbous so I don't have a clear idea on what it &gt;could be besides ordering the part and trying it out. And if it was then the mental orientation of the gas/liquid entering the union seems to go against the intended connection points that I &gt;would assume vacuum ejectors to opperrate at.
&gt;
&gt;But that is another point of concern that I can figure out down the road. The two bigger questions for this would be in how to eliminate two big pink elephants to make the jockey box &gt;standalone. It's the kegs for the cold brew and the nitrogen tank.
&gt;
&gt;One idea that I am having is to use a Flojet BW5000 to push the cold brew from a holding tank that I can place in the lower shelf of the jockey box and have that entering the infusion &gt;module. has anyone tried using the Flojet with anything other than water before and if so what was the results in your attempt.
&gt;
&gt;For the nitrogen I was looking up nitrogen pumps/generators that are small scale and I found one from Bunn the Nitron that I can utilize for that. The only concern I would have is that if i&gt;t could project sufficient pressure. If not I might need to have a fill canister and a regulator somewhere into the build for it which seems likely.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone tried any of this and if so please throw some ideas. I'll keep updates on the project as new developments come up.
&gt;
&gt;Here's the old jockey box I'm working on for this project I made a year ago. https://imgur.com/gallery/u33oMii

UPDATE:

So I ran the system after getting all the proper fittings and frankensteining hose's and adaptors so that I can run it to a nitrogen tank and regulator that we have. Think 1/2 barb fitting being reduced to standard 3/8 line reduced to a 1/4 line to go into the nitrogen gas adjustment valve. It works perfectly to my expectations and comes out like it does for our built in kegerator and nitrogen infuser.

Update with Guide: 
Rough guide on how to make one for yourself

So the basic idea on building a nitro cold brew kegerator is simple. You get either a jockey box or an actual refrigerated kegerator system. The latter is simple and takes most of the work out of the build but also the most expensive. If you go with a jockey box route you can reduce the price from a couple grand to somewhere close to 1/10th the price; if not more depending on how simple or elaborate you want to make it. 

If you choose to go with the former option then keep reading, other wise skip the next few paragraphs.

**Box**
If you want to make it simple there are jockey box kits you can buy that people usually have for tailgate parties. Those have pre-tapped holes and fittings for the beer taps you can swap out for high flow draft taps you want for nitro cold brew, as well as the coils and shank fitting for your product line which ideally would be going to a keg of some sort. (I will be going into how do run a system without a keg IE a simple container/bucket/cambro). And another option is similar to what I have done in the main post which is a beer tower. The one thing that you need to be mindful of for the tower is that you will need to do some fittings to get the beer tower lines to fit to the cooling coils. If the coil have npt threaded fittings this is simple and jsut involves down sizing enough to get a small push in fitting that the beer line can go to. Otherwise if its a naked coil with no fittings this can be simply achieve by getting a food safe line that has a ID that is just barely smaller than the coil OD so that once you fit it on you can tighten to get a airtight seal with a worm clamp. 

**Lines**
To make your life eternally easier buy some no drip DQC's (aka QDC, quick disconnect, quick connects, dripless quick connects, ect) And have that before AND after the coil so that you can take out the coil from the jockey box and clean more efficiently. For the lines doing into the box from the gas and the keg/product container you can do it many ways. As you can see in my pictures there is that weird awkward box with the DQC on them and that was a result of measuring once and cutting before double checking clearance space. The smarter thing to do now that I have worked on this over the year would be to use a bulkhead passthrough fitting/threaded tube that you can anchor down with a lock and nut. From there I would get some kind of threaded adaptor to fit DQC's to them to give it a good clean look for the outside and just a regular line inside to the DQC that feeds into the cold coils. And then DQC's ont he sankey or keg coupler lines as well.

**Nitrogen Gas**
Now is for the Nitrogen gas. The typical way would be to connect it to either a nitrogen tank or a nitrogen generator system with a regulator to adjust the pressure to push out the cold brew in a keg to dispense the coldbrew through a tap. For this I would recommend using a manifold to split the gas line to push the cold brew in the keg and another to go into the infusion system I will elaborate on later. Each of the output from the manifold should have a shut off valve and attach air quick connects to them so that you can close off lines you are not using or dont have yet for easy expansion. If you are using a sankey keg or a more typical standard keg coupler I recommend attaching air quick connects to the lines for clean and quick attachments to the box. 

**No Keg method**
For a system that is not used in a keg you would need some kind of pump system to push the cold brew through the system when you pull down the tap. For this you will want a pump with a pressure switch like a flojet. I think the best option would be the [flojet bevjet compact](https://www.amazon.com/Flojet-Bevjet-Compact-Adapter-approx/dp/B06XPY9CSN) as it is sold options for what fittings you want in our case push in fittings. You can then just simply put your line for the bevjet input into the container and let it sit in the bottom. Or you can modify your container by dirlling out a hole near the base and fitting a [right angle push in stem fitting](https://www.amazon.com/John-Guest-Copolymer-Connect-Fitting/dp/B007COM8TI) inside of it so that you can syphon out as much of the cold brew and not waste it(noone lieks to waste good cold brew). From there you follow the same method and fit the cold brew to a DQC to the in line from the [Bevjet](https://www.amazon.com/Flojet-Bevjet-Compact-Adapter-approx/dp/B06XPY9CSN)

**Nitro Infusion System**
Now this is the meat aand bones of the reason why I made this post. The nitro infusion system. You can go out and spend $600~800 for a completed looking box that you attached to your system and call it a day. But you can also just buy 4 to 5 fittings to do the exact same thing. First the required ones will be an [inline speed control valve](https://www.grainger.com/product/SMC-In-Line-Speed-Control-Valve-4DGV3?cm_sp=Home-_-MyPurchasedProducts-_-4DGV3&amp;cm_vc=HPMPPZ), T/Y splitter fitting, and 2 [liquid check valve fittings](https://www.grainger.com/product/JOHN-GUEST-Check-Valve-2JFY8?cm_sp=Home-_-MyPurchasedProducts-_-2JFY8&amp;cm_vc=HPMPPZ)

Arrange them like so:


Column A | Column B | Column C | Column D | Column E
---------|----------|----------|----------|----------
Line out|&lt;&lt;&lt;|T/Y Splitter|&lt;&lt;&lt;|Check Valve
 | |^| | 
 | |Check Valve|&lt;&lt;&lt;|Control Valve

This would be located inside of the box and the smart location to place it would be in between the output of the cold coil and the input of the beer tower/spout.
Side note I forgot to mention you need to run a line of nitrogen gas into the box so be creative on how you want to do it I've explained how to get the cold brew in here so its simple from the manifold that the nitrogen gas spits from the outside.

And then you just adjust the gas with the speed control valve to get a nice creamy texture for the cold brew","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preface, just updated my last few posts with a short guide on what I went through to make my nitro jockey box so that its more visible for anyone who wnats to take a crack at it. link to the original post for the comments

If you want to make it simple there are jockey box kits you can buy that people usually have for tailgate parties. Those have pre-tapped holes and fittings for the beer taps you can swap out for high flow draft taps you want for nitro cold brew, as well as the coils and shank fitting for your product line which ideally would be going to a keg of some sort. (I will be going into how do run a system without a keg IE a simple container/bucket/cambro). And another option is similar to what I have done in the main post which is a beer tower. The one thing that you need to be mindful of for the tower is that you will need to do some fittings to get the beer tower lines to fit to the cooling coils. If the coil have npt threaded fittings this is simple and jsut involves down sizing enough to get a small push in fitting that the beer line can go to. Otherwise if its a naked coil with no fittings this can be simply achieve by getting a food safe line that has a ID that is just barely smaller than the coil OD so that once you fit it on you can tighten to get a airtight seal with a worm clamp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lines&lt;/strong&gt;
To make your life eternally easier buy some no drip DQC&amp;#39;s (aka QDC, quick disconnect, quick connects, dripless quick connects, ect) And have that before AND after the coil so that you can take out the coil from the jockey box and clean more efficiently. For the lines doing into the box from the gas and the keg/product container you can do it many ways. As you can see in my pictures there is that weird awkward box with the DQC on them and that was a result of measuring once and cutting before double checking clearance space. The smarter thing to do now that I have worked on this over the year would be to use a bulkhead passthrough fitting/threaded tube that you can anchor down with a lock and nut. From there I would get some kind of threaded adaptor to fit DQC&amp;#39;s to them to give it a good clean look for the outside and just a regular line inside to the DQC that feeds into the cold coils. And then DQC&amp;#39;s ont he sankey or keg coupler lines as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nitrogen Gas&lt;/strong&gt;
Now is for the Nitrogen gas. The typical way would be to connect it to either a nitrogen tank or a nitrogen generator system with a regulator to adjust the pressure to push out the cold brew in a keg to dispense the coldbrew through a tap. For this I would recommend using a manifold to split the gas line to push the cold brew in the keg and another to go into the infusion system I will elaborate on later. Each of the output from the manifold should have a shut off valve and attach air quick connects to them so that you can close off lines you are not using or dont have yet for easy expansion. If you are using a sankey keg or a more typical standard keg coupler I recommend attaching air quick connects to the lines for clean and quick attachments to the box. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Keg method&lt;/strong&gt;
For a system that is not used in a keg you would need some kind of pump system to push the cold brew through the system when you pull down the tap. For this you will want a pump with a pressure switch like a flojet. I think the best option would be the &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Flojet-Bevjet-Compact-Adapter-approx/dp/B06XPY9CSN""&gt;flojet bevjet compact&lt;/a&gt; as it is sold options for what fittings you want in our case push in fittings. You can then just simply put your line for the bevjet input into the container and let it sit in the bottom. Or you can modify your container by dirlling out a hole near the base and fitting a &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/John-Guest-Copolymer-Connect-Fitting/dp/B007COM8TI""&gt;right angle push in stem fitting&lt;/a&gt; inside of it so that you can syphon out as much of the cold brew and not waste it(noone lieks to waste good cold brew). From there you follow the same method and fit the cold brew to a DQC to the in line from the &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Flojet-Bevjet-Compact-Adapter-approx/dp/B06XPY9CSN""&gt;Bevjet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nitro Infusion System&lt;/strong&gt;
Now this is the meat aand bones of the reason why I made this post. The nitro infusion system. You can go out and spend $600~800 for a completed looking box that you attached to your system and call it a day. But you can also just buy 4 to 5 fittings to do the exact same thing. First the required ones will be an &lt;a href=""https://www.grainger.com/product/SMC-In-Line-Speed-Control-Valve-4DGV3?cm_sp=Home-_-MyPurchasedProducts-_-4DGV3&amp;amp;cm_vc=HPMPPZ""&gt;inline speed control valve&lt;/a&gt;, T/Y splitter fitting, and 2 &lt;a href=""https://www.grainger.com/product/JOHN-GUEST-Check-Valve-2JFY8?cm_sp=Home-_-MyPurchasedProducts-_-2JFY8&amp;amp;cm_vc=HPMPPZ""&gt;liquid check valve fittings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrange them like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Column A&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Column B&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Column C&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Column D&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Column E&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Line out&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;T/Y Splitter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Check Valve&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;^&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Check Valve&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Control Valve&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be located inside of the box and the smart location to place it would be in between the output of the cold coil and the input of the beer tower/spout.
Side note I forgot to mention you need to run a line of nitrogen gas into the box so be creative on how you want to do it I&amp;#39;ve explained how to get the cold brew in here so its simple from the manifold that the nitrogen gas spits from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you just adjust the gas with the speed control valve to get a nice creamy texture for the cold brew&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any idea on how could I clean this up? Buying a new one is quite expensive where I live, so any advice to fix it would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

So I've been browsing used Espresso machines online and found an amazing price for a breville Dual Boiler. It is about one year old with all the accessories included.

The seller says he did a descale using the breville cleaning products, as he usually does - then afterwards, the machine would turn itself off about 5 seconds after being switched on.  

I know very little about Espresso machines having never owned one.

I only mention that because I don't recall now if the problem I'm about to describe existed with the original filters. BTW - the product only came with 20 filters and they don't sell replacements.

Anyway - I've been having a wide range of results on the total time of my brew. From around 3:15 to up to 5 minutes. The grind is just a bit finer than medium and I don't think it is the cause.

I have noticed that when I put in the dry filter and then wet it that sometimes it seems to make a seal around the complete circumference. And sometimes it lists to one side creating a seal all the way up and leaves a little gap across the way. 

I am pretty sure the shorter brew times are when more air can easily get into the bowl. And the longer brew times are when the seal is tight.

When I look at a picture of a Chemex it looks like the pour spout has groove that extends far enough down into the bowl as to keep a full seal from ever happening. Which, I would assume, would lead to more consistent brew times since the the water can pass through without artificial restriction.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know if the gears have been replaced from plastic to another material? Not willing to spend more than the $80 or so for a grinder, and I see that the white color is on sale for a little bit below that price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I found this number:   1-800-23-BODUM (26386)  from the warranty PDF on Amazon. I called the number, and got some special &amp;quot;promotion for people over the age of 50&amp;quot; line. Sounds scammy.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been experimenting on-and-off with this type of brewing. It is highly impractical for travel/quick preparation, but I'm starting to like it more and more as my ""fake pour-over"" method. I don't have the right hardware to do a decent pourover (mainly I would need a new kettle), but anyway, this is what I've been playing with:

- Start with 15-20g medium fine ground coffee (weighing after grinding) in the Aeropress in the original configuration (non-invert).

- Add 6x grind weight hot water, blooms/stir gently for 30 seconds. At 1 minute, use a few 1/2 inch plunges to force the brew through the aeropress (plunge about half an inch so that the coffee is forced through the filter, then lift plunger and repeat so that air is not sucked back through the Aeropress). Repeat till air is hissing through the grinds, 10-15 seconds.

- Add 10x grind weight hot water, stir gently to break up the compressed coffee at the bottom. Do a regular plunge at 1 minute, second brew time about 1:20. 

I'm not saying this is optimal or anything, just relatively easy to pull off. I find I get a sweeter brew with distinct flavors that is less bitter and less ""muddy"" in character. It also let's you brew a larger cup of coffee (e.g. using 20g of coffee, I end up with ~320 mL of finished coffee, which doesn't fit in an aeropress). 

Downsides - obviously it is twice the work, and therefore twice as fiddly (arguably even more fiddly with the initial extraction requiring small plunges). It also seems to require a fresher filter. I reuse my filters 10+ times, but this method works better with a much newer filter. Also, maybe I'm just crazy and don't know what coffee is supposed to taste like. 

Anyway, curious to hear if anyone else has tried 2x or more aeropress brews (I recall reading about one person at a competition using this approach, but they apparently didn't do well). I tried several configurations of 3x brewing, but I couldn't get consistent results (waaay to fiddly), and often ended up over-extracting things.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else played around with Aeropress double extraction recipes?

Which one of the two would you recommend? And can I also make normal coffee in these or does it have to be strictly espresso?&lt;br/&gt;

All, I was inspired by the Canekicker recipe seen on here as well as a gentleman named Perger and articles on Barista hustle and other websites. I made this chart so you can achieve hardness you desire from either tap water or water available to you at store filling stations etc. The Primo water dispenser at my Walmart is tested at 0 dKH 0 dGH (using aquarium test kit) and I aim for 35 ppm alkalinity (2 KH) and 85 ppm mineral hardness (aka 5 GH). Therefore I add 20.5 grains of baking soda and 65.1 grains of Epsom Salt heptahydrate. I am easily able to use grains because I have a reloading scale for ammunition, but you can multiply by 454/7000 to convert to grams if you have an accurate high resolution scale.

 I think the Canekicker recipe is a little high in hardness for me so mine is toned down a little bit. On the other hand my baking soda additions come out different than other sites tell you. A lot of them seem to be using math that baking soda dissociates to 495 ppm as CaCO3 but I believe it should be calculated as 381 ppm as CaCO3, so one site would list my dose as coming out to 40 ppm whereas I believe it's actually closer to 30. This is one reason among many that I target 35 (I am close to either one that is ""correct""). Mine is very close to the Perger recipe. Here are two more images, showing the calculator I developed which allows me to put in a target along with source water information (tap at x/y, RO at 0/0, etc) and finally the Perger and Canekicker recipes just as a check you can look at.

Canekicker's recipe in the image above makes 1 gallon that is then used as a 10% solution, IE if I am making a pourover I would use 50 mL (g) of his solution and 450 mL (g) of source (RO) water. Thus it makes a total of 37.85 Liters of solution or 10 gallons. 

Because I buy water in 5 gal bottles what I do is remove 1/2 gallon from the bottle, mix in my salts and heat it up and stir it, then pour it back into the bottle. Really I am just making the entire 5 gallon solution, and I could direct dose to the bottle if I felt it would mix OK.  An hour or so later it is sufficiently mixed for use; I have a $9 pump that sits on the 5 gallon bottle and I fill a 1 gallon pitcher in my fridge with this which lets me fill my drip maker or make pourovers for 4-5 days before I pump another gallon in.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

I used to use a moka pot (stove top) to make coffee, using 80% arabica and 20% robusta pre-ground coffee (supermarket one, powdery and rather dry).

By reading posts here I realised I should try freshly ground coffee. So I got a burr grinder and bought some hasbean blake black blend beans, freshly roasted (~7-10 days from roasting now).

I tried to grind at different coarseness level but I was getting always an underextracted coffee, very acidic and watery.
So I kept making the ground finer and finer, I think up to espresso level (max level in the grinder), but for some reasons it still get watery and acidic and I don't understand why.

What I reckon is that the supermarket moka ground is very dry, while mine is very sticky/oily (like wet sand? I can almost shape it) and this makes the stove pot pass easily through it somehow?

Indeed, the supermarket one takes a lot of time to build pressure and go out, while with the freshly roasted it goes out quickly.

So to summarise I tried to compress the grounds and to make it finer, but I can't seem to get the stove pot build enough pressure to extract the coffee at the right temperature/for the right amount of time.

Any suggestion? Maybe I should try less oily beans? Even finer grouding? Dry the beans more? Wait them to be slightly stale?

&lt;p&gt;By reading posts here I realised I should try freshly ground coffee. So I got a burr grinder and bought some hasbean blake black blend beans, freshly roasted (~7-10 days from roasting now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to grind at different coarseness level but I was getting always an underextracted coffee, very acidic and watery.
So I kept making the ground finer and finer, I think up to espresso level (max level in the grinder), but for some reasons it still get watery and acidic and I don&amp;#39;t understand why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I reckon is that the supermarket moka ground is very dry, while mine is very sticky/oily (like wet sand? I can almost shape it) and this makes the stove pot pass easily through it somehow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the supermarket one takes a lot of time to build pressure and go out, while with the freshly roasted it goes out quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to summarise I tried to compress the grounds and to make it finer, but I can&amp;#39;t seem to get the stove pot build enough pressure to extract the coffee at the right temperature/for the right amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestion? Maybe I should try less oily beans? Even finer grouding? Dry the beans more? Wait them to be slightly stale?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

Nice flavour, could get nice acidity which I enjoy, and repeatable results.

Queue the death of my Hob, an upgrade to Induction, and therefor an upgrade of my Moka pot for induction. A 4 cup Moka Venus.

This is giving me dreadful results. Everyday, twice a day, for a month.

First of all, The 4 Cup Moka Venus has a SMALLER coffee capacity, than my 3 cup Moka Express. But delivers more, (but weaker) coffee. What? Why?

I can't control the pot, it's either not enough heat to create pressure to force water through the grounds (80°C/100°C), or too much pressure and spluttering (120°C). Either way Results are burnt in taste, and weak. There is no middle ground between 100°C and 120°C.

Results are NOT repeatable. My girlfriend can get a good shot out sometimes. She swears by 80°C. When I use 80°C I don't get enough pressure. Sometimes 100°C works well for me, but still not particularly great taste. 120°C at least I can get enough water through, it just splutters the entire time. We're doing the exact same method. I just cannot wrap my head around it, it's inconsistent. 

Change in grind size, amount of coffee, temperature, and bean variety have not improved my situation. The only thing that has helped my case slightly is starting from cold water instead of off the boil, which is the opposite effect of the results I got in the Express. Why?

So those of you who are using induction to make their coffee, what's your method, what are you using, and what are your results like?

Are induction hobs just not suitable for stovetop coffee?

Is the Venus crap? [Moka Induction](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bialetti-Moka-Induction-Coffee-Makers/dp/B00LK9CM5Q) better?

Hi guys,  

First time posting here. I have a small project I'm working on at work. I'm trying to make some revisions on our cold brew portable jockey box so that it can be used as a near standalone portable nitro kegerator. I'm I am trying to build from scratch something similar to the Kegoutlet's Nitro Infuser/Micromatic Mininim nitrogen infusion module. I have taken apart both and examined the components and am curious about one part in particular which might be a hitch in the planning phase.  

Inside there is a T union for when the cold brew and the nitrogen blend. I'm curious if a vacuum ejector is what that part is as its pretty bulbous so I don't have a clear idea on what it could be besides ordering the part and trying it out. And if it was then the mental orientation of the gas/liquid entering the union seems to go against the intended connection points that I would assume vacuum ejectors to opperrate at.

But that is another point of concern that I can figure out down the road. The two bigger questions for this would be in how to eliminate two big pink elephants to make the jockey box standalone. It's the kegs for the cold brew and the nitrogen tank.  

One idea that I am having is to use a Flojet BW5000 to push the cold brew from a holding tank that I can place in the lower shelf of the jockey box and have that entering the infusion module. has anyone tried using the Flojet with anything other than water before and if so what was the results in your attempt.  

For the nitrogen I was looking up nitrogen pumps/generators that are small scale and I found one from Bunn the Nitron that I can utilize for that. The only concern I would have is that if it could project sufficient pressure. If not I might need to have a fill canister and a regulator somewhere into the build for it which seems likely.


Has anyone tried any of this and if so please throw some ideas. I'll keep updates on the project as new developments come up.

Here's the old jockey box I'm working on for this project I made a year ago.

UPDATE:

So I ran the system after getting all the proper fittings and frankensteining hose's and adaptors so that I can run it to a nitrogen tank and regulator that we have. Think 1/2 barb fitting being reduced to standard 3/8 line reduced to a 1/4 line to go into the nitrogen gas adjustment valve. It works perfectly to my expectations and comes out like it does for our built in kegerator and nitrogen infuser. 

Video Update of the output:

UPDATE:
Rough guide on how to make one for yourself

So the basic idea on building a nitro cold brew kegerator is simple. You get either a jockey box or an actual refrigerated kegerator system. The latter is simple and takes most of the work out of the build but also the most expensive. If you go with a jockey box route you can reduce the price from a couple grand to somewhere close to 1/10th the price; if not more depending on how simple or elaborate you want to make it. 

If you choose to go with the former option then keep reading, other wise skip the next few paragraphs.

**Box**
If you want to make it simple there are jockey box kits you can buy that people usually have for tailgate parties. Those have pre-tapped holes and fittings for the beer taps you can swap out for high flow draft taps you want for nitro cold brew, as well as the coils and shank fitting for your product line which ideally would be going to a keg of some sort. (I will be going into how do run a system without a keg IE a simple container/bucket/cambro). And another option is similar to what I have done in the main post which is a beer tower. The one thing that you need to be mindful of for the tower is that you will need to do some fittings to get the beer tower lines to fit to the cooling coils. If the coil have npt threaded fittings this is simple and jsut involves down sizing enough to get a small push in fitting that the beer line can go to. Otherwise if its a naked coil with no fittings this can be simply achieve by getting a food safe line that has a ID that is just barely smaller than the coil OD so that once you fit it on you can tighten to get a airtight seal with a worm clamp. 

**Lines**
To make your life eternally easier buy some no drip DQC's (aka QDC, quick disconnect, quick connects, dripless quick connects, ect) And have that before AND after the coil so that you can take out the coil from the jockey box and clean more efficiently. For the lines doing into the box from the gas and the keg/product container you can do it many ways. As you can see in my pictures there is that weird awkward box with the DQC on them and that was a result of measuring once and cutting before double checking clearance space. The smarter thing to do now that I have worked on this over the year would be to use a bulkhead passthrough fitting/threaded tube that you can anchor down with a lock and nut. From there I would get some kind of threaded adaptor to fit DQC's to them to give it a good clean look for the outside and just a regular line inside to the DQC that feeds into the cold coils. And then DQC's ont he sankey or keg coupler lines as well.

**Nitrogen Gas**
Now is for the Nitrogen gas. The typical way would be to connect it to either a nitrogen tank or a nitrogen generator system with a regulator to adjust the pressure to push out the cold brew in a keg to dispense the coldbrew through a tap. For this I would recommend using a manifold to split the gas line to push the cold brew in the keg and another to go into the infusion system I will elaborate on later. Each of the output from the manifold should have a shut off valve and attach air quick connects to them so that you can close off lines you are not using or dont have yet for easy expansion. If you are using a sankey keg or a more typical standard keg coupler I recommend attaching air quick connects to the lines for clean and quick attachments to the box. 

**No Keg method**
For a system that is not used in a keg you would need some kind of pump system to push the cold brew through the system when you pull down the tap. For this you will want a pump with a pressure switch like a flojet. I think the best option would be the [flojet bevjet compact](https://www.amazon.com/Flojet-Bevjet-Compact-Adapter-approx/dp/B06XPY9CSN) as it is sold options for what fittings you want in our case push in fittings. You can then just simply put your line for the bevjet input into the container and let it sit in the bottom. Or you can modify your container by dirlling out a hole near the base and fitting a [right angle push in stem fitting](https://www.amazon.com/John-Guest-Copolymer-Connect-Fitting/dp/B007COM8TI) inside of it so that you can syphon out as much of the cold brew and not waste it(noone lieks to waste good cold brew). From there you follow the same method and fit the cold brew to a DQC to the in line from the [Bevjet](https://www.amazon.com/Flojet-Bevjet-Compact-Adapter-approx/dp/B06XPY9CSN)

**Nitro Infusion System**
Now this is the meat aand bones of the reason why I made this post. The nitro infusion system. You can go out and spend $600~800 for a completed looking box that you attached to your system and call it a day. But you can also just buy 4 to 5 fittings to do the exact same thing. First the required ones will be an (inline speed control valve)[https://www.grainger.com/product/SMC-In-Line-Speed-Control-Valve-4DGV3?cm_sp=Home-_-MyPurchasedProducts-_-4DGV3&amp;cm_vc=HPMPPZ], T/Y splitter fitting, and 2 (liquid check valve fittings)[https://www.grainger.com/product/JOHN-GUEST-Check-Valve-2JFY8?cm_sp=Home-_-MyPurchasedProducts-_-2JFY8&amp;cm_vc=HPMPPZ]

Arrange them like so:

Line out -&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;- T/Y Splitter -&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; - Check Valve

Column A | Column B | Column C | Column D | Column E
---------|----------|----------|----------|----------
Line out|&lt;&lt;&lt;|T/Y Splitter|&lt;&lt;&lt;|Check Valve
 | |^| | 
 | |Check Valve|&lt;&lt;&lt;|Control Valve

This would be located inside of the box and the smart location to place it would be in between the output of the cold coil and the input of the beer tower/spout.
Side note I forgot to mention you need to run a line of nitrogen gas into the box so be creative on how you want to do it I've explained how to get the cold brew in here so its simple from the manifold that the nitrogen gas spits from the outside.

And then you just adjust the gas with the speed control valve to get a nice creamy texture for the cold brew","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Link to new main post for further discussion

&lt;p&gt;Hi guys,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time posting here. I have a small project I&amp;#39;m working on at work. I&amp;#39;m trying to make some revisions on our cold brew portable jockey box so that it can be used as a near standalone portable nitro kegerator. I&amp;#39;m I am trying to build from scratch something similar to the Kegoutlet&amp;#39;s Nitro Infuser/Micromatic Mininim nitrogen infusion module. I have taken apart both and examined the components and am curious about one part in particular which might be a hitch in the planning phase.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside there is a T union for when the cold brew and the nitrogen blend. I&amp;#39;m curious if a vacuum ejector is what that part is as its pretty bulbous so I don&amp;#39;t have a clear idea on what it could be besides ordering the part and trying it out. And if it was then the mental orientation of the gas/liquid entering the union seems to go against the intended connection points that I would assume vacuum ejectors to opperrate at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is another point of concern that I can figure out down the road. The two bigger questions for this would be in how to eliminate two big pink elephants to make the jockey box standalone. It&amp;#39;s the kegs for the cold brew and the nitrogen tank.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One idea that I am having is to use a Flojet BW5000 to push the cold brew from a holding tank that I can place in the lower shelf of the jockey box and have that entering the infusion module. has anyone tried using the Flojet with anything other than water before and if so what was the results in your attempt.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the nitrogen I was looking up nitrogen pumps/generators that are small scale and I found one from Bunn the Nitron that I can utilize for that. The only concern I would have is that if it could project sufficient pressure. If not I might need to have a fill canister and a regulator somewhere into the build for it which seems likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone tried any of this and if so please throw some ideas. I&amp;#39;ll keep updates on the project as new developments come up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the old jockey box I&amp;#39;m working on for this project I made a year ago.
&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/u33oMii""&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/u33oMii&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I ran the system after getting all the proper fittings and frankensteining hose&amp;#39;s and adaptors so that I can run it to a nitrogen tank and regulator that we have. Think 1/2 barb fitting being reduced to standard 3/8 line reduced to a 1/4 line to go into the nitrogen gas adjustment valve. It works perfectly to my expectations and comes out like it does for our built in kegerator and nitrogen infuser. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video Update of the output:
&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/VP0W0Ds""&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/VP0W0Ds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:
Rough guide on how to make one for yourself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the basic idea on building a nitro cold brew kegerator is simple. You get either a jockey box or an actual refrigerated kegerator system. The latter is simple and takes most of the work out of the build but also the most expensive. If you go with a jockey box route you can reduce the price from a couple grand to somewhere close to 1/10th the price; if not more depending on how simple or elaborate you want to make it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you choose to go with the former option then keep reading, other wise skip the next few paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Box&lt;/strong&gt;
If you want to make it simple there are jockey box kits you can buy that people usually have for tailgate parties. Those have pre-tapped holes and fittings for the beer taps you can swap out for high flow draft taps you want for nitro cold brew, as well as the coils and shank fitting for your product line which ideally would be going to a keg of some sort. (I will be going into how do run a system without a keg IE a simple container/bucket/cambro). And another option is similar to what I have done in the main post which is a beer tower. The one thing that you need to be mindful of for the tower is that you will need to do some fittings to get the beer tower lines to fit to the cooling coils. If the coil have npt threaded fittings this is simple and jsut involves down sizing enough to get a small push in fitting that the beer line can go to. Otherwise if its a naked coil with no fittings this can be simply achieve by getting a food safe line that has a ID that is just barely smaller than the coil OD so that once you fit it on you can tighten to get a airtight seal with a worm clamp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lines&lt;/strong&gt;
To make your life eternally easier buy some no drip DQC&amp;#39;s (aka QDC, quick disconnect, quick connects, dripless quick connects, ect) And have that before AND after the coil so that you can take out the coil from the jockey box and clean more efficiently. For the lines doing into the box from the gas and the keg/product container you can do it many ways. As you can see in my pictures there is that weird awkward box with the DQC on them and that was a result of measuring once and cutting before double checking clearance space.

From there I would get some kind of threaded adaptor to fit DQC&amp;#39;s to them to give it a good clean look for the outside and just a regular line inside to the DQC that feeds into the cold coils. And then DQC&amp;#39;s ont he sankey or keg coupler lines as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nitrogen Gas&lt;/strong&gt;
Now is for the Nitrogen gas. The typical way would be to connect it to either a nitrogen tank or a nitrogen generator system with a regulator to adjust the pressure to push out the cold brew in a keg to dispense the coldbrew through a tap.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Keg method&lt;/strong&gt;

For this you will want a pump with a pressure switch like a flojet.

I have made some interesting observations after some experiments. Note that my way of tasting and technique is nowhere near consistant or scientific but I think it is still interesting.

For 7 days I brewed two cups of Colombia Ibague with a ratio of 18g coffee to 300ml water. I would describe the coffee as roasted nuts with a fruity and acidic finish. One cup is brewed with 01 size v60 and the other 02 size. Grind size medium-fine (14 on Encore). Water is filters with a Britta filter, it is neutral tasting but I think it is not the optimal.

Observations: 01 size has a longer brewing time averaging around 2:30. 02 size is quicker, averaging less than 2:10. And 01 generally tastes less acidic, but have some note of overextraction, a smoky and ashy texture. 02 is smoother, but more acidic, expecially when I get to the bottom of the cup, it is harsh and salty. The difference is noticable.

My theory is that because of the smaller size of 01, it limits the waterflow and cause a more overextracted brew. And somehow I find 01 size filters to be relatively thicker. But I have no scientific way to measure it at the moment.

I was never a big fan of coffee until my mid to late 20s.  Never really liked it as a teen and in my 20s for whatever reason one day I got a mocha-chino you know half hot chocolate and half coffee.  Well shortly after this I realized my work had a coffee machine with this choice so I developed a taste for coffee but just a start.  I was so into the sweet taste that if I were to drink a coffee on it's own I would put in at least 5 scoops of sugar but could even do more if I felt like it.  When it came to cream it was just 2 servings of it in my coffee. (or one at Tim Horton's as they use 18% cream and more than one tastes sludgy IMHO).

&amp;#x200B;

My main reason for cutting back on the sugar was actually when I was losing a bunch of weight   I switched my 18% cream to 2% milk and got it down to 3 sugar when was able to cut out the milk.

&amp;#x200B;

Drank 3 sugar for a bit then cut it down to 1.

&amp;#x200B;

That 1 scoop took forever for me to finally kick.  I tried to do it a few times before I was actually able to do it.  It actually feels funny drinking coffee with cream or sugar and I don't like the taste anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I thank anyone for listening and hopefully enjoying my path down the dark path.  I just needed to write it down while I finish my 24OZ cup of black coffee.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does everyone drink their coffee?

Quick shout out to the community for getting me into and guiding me through the world of coffee. It's been a fun and delicious journey.

I have a batch of Ethiopian Yirgacheffe that I roasted myself, City Roast. This morning was the first brew. 

In a v60 for a 300ml cup I would normally set my burr grinder between a 4 and 5 (where smaller is finer). I accidentally left it set to an 8 (slightly courser than midpoint). I made the cup anyways and decided I'd experiment and see how it tasted beside a brew of the typical finer grind size.

I was pretty surprised actually. With all other variables isolated (water off boil, same pour method, same ratio), the finer grind seemed to produce a cup with less flavour. Specifically the courser grind seemed to have a more acidic, citrusy, fruity punch. The finer grind seemed to lose this quality, with maaaybe the addition of some very slight floral tones, but also a seemingly woody aftertaste. Overall less flavour, though.

How would you interpret this? I wouldn't have assumed over extracting could produce less flavour - or the vice versa, under extracting produce more. Is this more citrusy brew simply under extracted and thus more sour?

I’ve brewed it twice so far and and it’s good, but there’s a hint of greatness in it that I’m just not latching on to. 

Here’s my brew setup:

Plastic v60, filtered water (nothing fancy), gooseneck kettle with thermometer, Baratza Encore grinder. “Rao” brew method.

1st brew:
Grind setting 16
Water temp 205F
20g coffee:320ml water
60ml bloom
Total brew time: 2:50

Taste: A bit under extracted, thin, astringent, flavors are evident but muted, short finish.

2nd brew: 
Grind setting 14
(All other variables the same)
Total brew time: 3:15

Taste: More balanced, slightly bitter, chocolate now noticeable, longer finish.

From here I’m open to suggestions. I’d like to try to squeeze a bit more flavor out of this coffee, but I’m not sure what to change next. First thought is to grind even finer, but since this is a medium roast maybe brewing it at a slightly lower temp (say 195F) might work better.

The Japanese have a method of cold brewing called the Kyoto technique. Some trendy coffee shops will use (cool but expensive) drip towers. Basically, one drop of water at a time is dropped onto the coffee grounds, and slowly makes its way through the grounds, producing VERY tasty and strong cold brew coffee. 

Well, for those of us who don’t want to spend hundreds of dollars on a drip tower, I have a solution! All you have to do is take whatever brewer you use for hot coffee (aeropress, Chemex, pour over apparatus, etc ANYTHING with a filter!) and put your grounds in it. A notable exception would be a French press (sorry). 

Next, literally all you have to do is get ice from your freezer and put it on top of the grounds. The ice melts at a similar rate that water would drip from a fancy drip tower, providing the same gravity-controlled brew rate. 

Now, I PROMISE that this will be done in the morning if you set it up before you go to bed. It’s a much faster process than immersion cold brew coffee!

I'm looking to do cold brew, so I tried a couple test settings past 28 (which the manual had listed for french press), when I saw that they were all producing a good amount finer particles, I just did a batch at 40, the highest setting, hoping that it would be okay.

I ground 3.75oz of whole beans, and got 3.7oz out of it.

This was the result I got: [https://imgur.com/j98cc9e](https://imgur.com/j98cc9e)

I noticed a pretty big mix of larger and smaller particles, so I decided to sift it for a bit, could've gone longer and used a more precise sifter, but for now just used what I had. There was a good amount finer particles that I wouldn't consider usable for cold brew. Also there seemed to be a ton of ""flakey"" pieces as well, I've never really seen that using any other grinder: [https://imgur.com/6gMTSiV](https://imgur.com/6gMTSiV)

I weighed out both amounts, of the usable grounds I got 3.05oz, and the finer particles resulted in .65oz, not exactly the result I was hoping for. The thing was, I probably could've kept sifting, but after a couple minutes I decided to stop there.

Now when I brew, I use the toddy, but also use those single use reusable bags that are made out of corn fiber, I find that they normally work really well with coarse ground coffee, and the double filter from the bag and the toddy filter usually work great. However as I put the bag in to brew, and turned it a couple times to make sure the entire bag and grounds got wet, I noticed there were still a ton of fine particles that leaked out, and instantly made the water look pretty cloudy. This did not really happen when I would fresh grind using the commercial grinder at the grocery store, set at the coarsest  setting. Normally it doesn't get this cloudy that quickly. You can even see some of the sediment that leaked out on the side of the toddy. Here was the result: [https://imgur.com/a2g9meO](https://imgur.com/a2g9meO)

And when I tilt it to see in the light, you can see all the fine particles at the bottom (that isn't noise from the camera): [https://imgur.com/irLrgfv](https://imgur.com/irLrgfv)

Normally when I brew this way, I don't get nearly as many fine particles that leak out. I've even used this exact roast before, ground at the supermarket, and it didn't look like this. I'm still going to give it a shot, and filter it a few more times if necessary, but the toddy filter usually does a decent job. but if any sludge or anything gets produced I know that can pass through the filter.

I have recently purchased a Chemex, Aeropress, Encore, and a gooseneck variable temp Bonavita kettle for making coffee in the morning. I don't have much experience, and I did a trial run last night with some older beans that I've had sitting in my cupboard for a year or two. 

1. When a recipe calls for 17g of coffee, for example, do you measure 17g of beans, grind them, and use those grounds in the recipe? Or do you grind a slightly larger amount and then measure 17g from that? 

2. Is there any harm in leaving the encore on for longer than necessary? Occasionally I had times where the one last bean was still swirling around like something circling the drain and I wasn't sure if I was doing any damage to the grinder by kind of just letting it run. 

3. My first attempt at an aeropress brew was using the traditional right-side up method. The recipe had me fill the vessel to the ""4"" line. I know it's normal for water to seep through the filter while pouring, but is it normal for the mug to be almost half full by the time I put the plunger in to create the seal? I then did another round with the upside down method which of course doesn't have this problem as much. 

4. So what's the deal with square chemex filters? I bought some not really knowing how to fold them, and I definitely did it wrong the first time. Do you just fold it into quarters, and put the corner that's the center at the square down into the vessel, and then take one of the leaves in the corner and make a cone out of that? 

Thanks. I know this would probably be more suitable for tomorrow's free talk thread but I thought I would ask now while it's all still on my mind.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello.

I bought some beans from a roaster recently that were a medium roast. Whenever I get pour over at a shop it is always typically a light roast coffee- but I have read that you can use medium roasts as well.

I've typically use light roast Ethiopian coffee for my pour overs- 18 grams of coffee to make 8-10 ounces of coffee in 2.5 minutes. I'm playing around with this Brazilian medium roast a bit- I find it is more palatable when it is a courser grain and a longer bloom time- so my total brew time is roughly 3.5 minutes.

The only source I found online was saying that medium roast pour over would have a quicker brew time than a light roast- if I exclude my bloom time that is true since my grind is more coarse, but I'm still unsure about the whole process- looking for a bit of guidance if anyone has any recommendations for pour over with a medium roast","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

I have some Brazilian pea berry (And Sidamo) that I have roasted to numerous different levels.  I make the coffee with a Chemex.  

I boil the water in a tea pot and then turn it off and let it cool for about 30 seconds.

I have tried using 40 grams of coffee up to 60 grams of coffee (for 900 grams of water.)

I have tried using paper filter, and metal filter. 

I have tried using the lighter roasts and the darker roasts.

I have tried course grind to fine grind. 

Same thing seems to happen every time... the coffee tastes pretty good but the more it cools the more nasty it gets.  By the time it's room temperature I can't even take a drink without making a face like I just had a shot of whiskey.  

I'm not very keen on being able to tell if it's bitter or sour...I understand the concepts in my head but I can't tell the difference :) 

Any idea what I can try?


EDIT: I'm an idiot....!  I tested the temp of the water after 30 seconds and it was still at 210.  I let it cool to 190 and now the (I'm assuming bitter) flavor is completely gone.

&lt;p&gt;It’s the first time I’ve ever seen Indian Arabica. As they are all usually robusta and mass produced.  &lt;/p&gt;

Did you/Should I attend coffee school? (I have the option of attending UCC Coffee Academy)

Did you/Should I read one book first and then used that to learn the next step? (I was thinking of starting with Coffee Atlas. Or maybe Craft Coffee though I don't know, humbly speaking, if the author is qualified to write about coffee and I want to prevent learning something I have to UNLEARN later.)

Which method did you/should I start with? (Espresso? V60? which I have read, watched videos about, but have no clue if it's a good starting point to learn about coffee)

What equipment/kit did you/should I start with? (I don't mind spending on equipment that will last me a decade or that I will use throughout my learning journey)

If you could redo your journey, where would you have started? What would you have done differently? What kit/gear would you have gotten? What would be a great jumping off point? Where did you waste time or resources in?

I've had my Breville Grinder Pro for ~2 years and it seemed to be doing great. It got to a point where it wasn't dispensing grounds, but after a quick air compressor blast it was back to grinding like a pro!

I went to a nice new coffee house and got a pour-over cup and was blown away.. I immediately ordered a chemex and some special coffee.

I tried grinding the coffee and it took forever for any coffee to come out of the Breville. Shaking etc didn't seem to help.

Lots of googling later and I learned that the impeller can wear down and fail to push the coffee out, but someone designed a 3D printed part to replace it. After getting the impeller out, I saw that I could wedge pieces of cut up straw between the metal impeller shield and the plastic impeller to extend the impeller slightly. Sweet! 

It definitely worked to clear the coffee grounds, but things were still slow! It looked like the chute was clogging.

I saw a video of Burr grinder cleaner beans and ordered some. They shot right through the grinder - success! I put some beans in, and tries grinding... It worked at first, but soon grounds would only flow on the coarsest setting. On the fine setting it sounded like the burrs were touching.

I tried changing the adjustable Burr to coarser, but the same problem (slightly better maybe?). I have no idea how the burr could move and get tighter, or how removing and replacing the burr could screw up it's height (its screwed on snug)...

At this rate I'm suuuuper frustrated with this thing and ready to call it quits. I'm going to call Breville tomorrow and see if they'll replace it, but preparing to buy a new (DIFFERENT) grinder.

Still with me? Great! Does anyone have suggestions for a durable, reliable grinder?

I grind for espresso, pour over, french press, and I have a Keurig refillable pod for a quick fix.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;

After getting the impeller out, I saw that I could wedge pieces of cut up straw between the metal impeller shield and the plastic impeller to extend the impeller slightly. Sweet! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It definitely worked to clear the coffee grounds, but things were still slow! It looked like the chute was clogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a video of Burr grinder cleaner beans and ordered some. They shot right through the grinder - success! I put some beans in, and tries grinding... It worked at first, but soon grounds would only flow on the coarsest setting. On the fine setting it sounded like the burrs were touching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried changing the adjustable Burr to coarser, but the same problem (slightly better maybe?). I have no idea how the burr could move and get tighter, or how removing and replacing the burr could screw up it&amp;#39;s height (its screwed on snug)...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this rate I&amp;#39;m suuuuper frustrated with this thing and ready to call it quits. I&amp;#39;m going to call Breville tomorrow and see if they&amp;#39;ll replace it, but preparing to buy a new (DIFFERENT) grinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still with me? Great! Does anyone have suggestions for a durable, reliable grinder?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grind for espresso, pour over, french press, and I have a Keurig refillable pod for a quick fix.&lt;/p&gt;

The only problem is..... I don't like the taste of black coffee... not even a little bit. Lately, I've been buying the premade iced coffee at target and drinking it with creamer which is pretty okay, but if I go to a cafe or if I make it at home I can't get it to taste good.

I don't want to load it up with sugar just to be able to stomach it. I'm wondering are there certain preparation methods that can make it easier on the taste buds for someone who hasn't acquired the taste for black coffee yet?

EDIT: I just don't have the means to buy good coffee or make good black coffee. I'm kind of wondering if there are favorable ways to add to coffee that isn't dumping 4 packets of sugar in it.
